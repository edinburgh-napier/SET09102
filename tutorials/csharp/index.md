The tutorials in this section are intended to get you started working with C# and in particular
the .NET Multi-platform App UI (MAUI). If you have already worked with C# in the past, you should
take the opportunity to extend your knowledge of the language. Tha might mean, for example, adding
other features into the examples provided here. If you have never worked with C#, this is an
opportunity to add one more language to your skillset.

## Requirements

If you are using your own computer for these exercises, you will need a working configuration.
The exercises assume that you will be using Visual Studio Code (VSCode), although other tools
are available such as [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) and
[Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/). If you want to use an alternative IDE/editor, you 
need to be prepared to adapt the instructions provided in the tutorials.

You should install [.NET 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) 
for the purposes of this module. Although .NET 9 is available, there may be some incompatibilities
with other software tools.
