The tutorials in this section are intended to get you started working with C# and in particular
the .NET Multi-platform App UI (MAUI). If you have already worked with C# in the past, you should
take the opportunity to extend your knowledge of the language. Tha might mean, for example, adding
other features into the examples provided here. If you have never worked with C#, this is an
opportunity to add one more language to your skillset.
