# StarterApp

The StarterApp provides a production-quality starting point for MAUI development projects. It demonstrates best practices for multi-project architecture and includes:

* **Multi-project solution** (UI, Database, Migrations)
* **Database integration** with Entity Framework Core and migrations
* **Role-based security** and authorization
* **Local authentication** with BCrypt password hashing
* **MVVM architecture** using CommunityToolkit.Mvvm
* **Dependency injection** throughout the application
* **Example navigation** with Shell

{: .important }
**PostgreSQL Version Available**: A PostgreSQL-ready version of StarterApp is available in the [SET09102 repository](https://github.com/edinburgh-napier/SET09102/tree/main/code/StarterApp). This version is used in the **[MAUI + MVVM + Database Tutorial](../maui-mvvm-database/)**, which is the recommended learning path.

## Learning Path
