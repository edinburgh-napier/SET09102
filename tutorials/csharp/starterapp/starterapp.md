# StarterApp

The StarterApp provides a starting point for a development project. It includes
basic features such as:

* Database integration and migrations
* Role-based security
* Local authentication
* Example navigation

The current version of the app uses SQL Server for data storage and Entity Framework Core for 
object-relational mapping and migrations.

To fully understand how it works, you should complete all the practice tutorials provided.
However, if you want to jump straight in and work out any problems as you go along, that will 
also work but you may spend a lot of time troubleshooting. The code uses structured comments for 
use with the [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/) documentation generator tool and one of the first 
things you should do is generate that documentation for your own reference.
