# Deprecated Tutorials

This directory contains older C# tutorials that have been superseded by the new **[MAUI + MVVM + Database](../maui-mvvm-database/)** combined tutorial.

## Why These Tutorials Are Deprecated

The original tutorial approach taught MAUI, MVVM, and database integration as separate progressive steps:
- Students started with file-based storage
- Later refactored to SQL Server
- Multiple refactoring cycles
- Disconnected learning experience

The new combined tutorial addresses these issues by:
- Teaching all concepts together from the start
- Using PostgreSQL (matching dev-environment setup)
- Working with production-quality code from day one
- Preparing for REST API integration
- Reducing unnecessary refactoring cycles

## Archived Tutorials

These tutorials are kept for reference but are no longer actively maintained:

- **database/** - SQL Server database integration tutorial
- **maui/** - Basic MAUI concepts tutorial
- **mvvm/** - MVVM pattern tutorial
- **migration/** - Database migration strategies tutorial

## Recommended Learning Path

New students should follow the [MAUI + MVVM + Database Tutorial](../maui-mvvm-database/) instead, which provides a more comprehensive and modern approach to learning .NET MAUI development.

## Note

The Jekyll front matter has been removed from all markdown files in this directory to prevent them from appearing in the generated GitHub Pages site.
