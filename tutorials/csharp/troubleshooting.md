    Android API level missing
</summary>
<p>If you see an error like the following, some Android dependencies are missing.</p>
<div class="callout codeblock">
<pre class="red">/.../Microsoft.Android.Sdk.Darwin/34.0.113/tools/Xamarin.Android.Tooling.targets(100,5): error XA5207: Could not find android.jar for 
API level 34. This means the Android SDK platform for API level 34 is not installed; it was expected to be in
`/PATH_TO_SDK/platforms/android-34/android.jar`.</pre>
</div>
<p>Install the missing dependencies by executing the following commands in a terminal window. Make sure that you are in the project directory. You also need to use the correct path for your Android SDK. The path you need is shown in the error message.</p>
<div class="callout codeblock">
<pre>export AcceptAndroidSDKLicenses=true
dotnet build -t:InstallAndroidDependencies -f net8.0-android "-p:AndroidSdkDirectory=/PATH_TO_SDK"</pre>

    Crash on start
</summary>
<p>If your application was previously working but starts to crash on starting up, it may be because some package versions have changed. Try removing all of the object and binary files and recompiling. Right-click on the project in the <strong>Solution Explorer</strong> and click <em>Clean</em></p>

    During setup, directories are created with percent signs in their names (e.g. %ANDROID_HOME%)
</summary>
<p>
This happens when you use the Windows PowerShell when running a terminal. Use the basic
CMD command window instead. You can configure your VSCode

 to use CMD by default

    Missing workloads
</summary>
<p>After certain updates, the .NET workloads associated with a project need to be reinstalled. When this happens, you will see an error like the following:</p>
<div class="callout codeblock">
<pre>  Determining projects to restore...
/.../Microsoft.NET.Sdk/targets/Microsoft.NET.Sdk.ImportWorkloads.targets(38,5): error NETSDK1147: To build this
project, the following workloads must be installed: wasi-experimental [/.../Notes/Notes.csproj::TargetFramework=net8.0-android]
/.../Microsoft.NET.Sdk/targets/Microsoft.NET.Sdk.ImportWorkloads.targets(38,5): error NETSDK1147: To install these workloads, 
run the following command: dotnet workload restore [/.../Notes/Notes.csproj::TargetFramework=net8.0-android]</pre>
</div>
<p>The command shown in the error message may not work if the restoration requires elevated privileges. On Mac or Linux, use the following command at a terminal prompt ensuring that you are in the project directory:</p>
<div class="callout codeblock">
<pre>sudo dotnet workload restore</pre>
</div>
<p>On Windows, start a command shell with administrator privilege, change into the project directory and execute the command:</p>
<div class="callout codeblock">
<pre>dotnet workload restore</pre>
</div>

<details class="blue-bar">
<summary>Package downgrade detected</summary>
<p>If you see an error like the following, it means that there is a conflict between different NuGet packages and you need to upgrade one or more of them to their latest version.</p>
<div class="callout codeblock">
<pre> Determining projects to restore...
  All projects are up-to-date for restore.
  Determining projects to restore...
/.../Notes/Notes.csproj : error NU1605: Warning As Error: Detected package downgrade: 
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore from 8.0.7 to 8.0.6. Reference the package directly from 
the project to select a different version.  [/.../Notes.sln]</pre>
</div>
<p>Look in the <code>Notes.sln</code> file to find the package that the error message refers to. Then, right-click on the project in the <strong>Solution Explorer</strong> and reinstall that package choosing the required version when prompted. This will update the references in the project file.</p>

<details class="blue-bar">
<summary>Platform simulator not found</summary>
<p>If you see an error like the following when building your code, your project file includes the iOS platform, but you do not have a simulator installed. </p>
<div class="callout codeblock">
<pre class="red">/.../Notes/obj/Debug/net8.0-ios/iossimulator-arm64/actool/cloned-assets/Assets.xcassets : actool error : The operation 
couldnâ€™t be completed. Failed to locate any simulator runtime matching options: { [/.../Notes/Notes.csproj::TargetFramework=net8.0-ios]</pre>
</div>
<p>The simplest solution is to remove the reference to iOS from the project file. Locate the <code>TargetFrameworks</code> entry near the start of the file and remove iOS as a target. The example below shows the line before and after the change.</p>
<div class="callout codeblock">
<pre>&lt;!-- BEFORE -->
&lt;TargetFrameworks>net8.0-android;net8.0-ios;net8.0-maccatalyst</TargetFrameworks>
&lt;!-- AFTER -->
&lt;TargetFrameworks>net8.0-android;net8.0-maccatalyst</TargetFrameworks></pre>
</div>
<p>If you prefer to install a simulator so that you can keep the iOS target, please refer to the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/ios/cli?view=net-maui-8.0" target="_blank">Microsoft documentation.</a></p>

<summary>Request nominateProject failure</summary>
<p>When starting VSCode, you may see the error below from time to time. It seems to arise when the host computer is busy and results from a race condition between different startup processes.</p>
<div class="callout codeblock">
<pre>LimitedFunctionality
StreamJsonRpc.RemoteInvocationException: Request nominateProject failed with message: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'size')</pre>

<p>The best solution seems to be to restart your computer to kill any unnecessary processes.</p>
