Software engineering is about more than writing code and building applications â€” it's about 
developing systems that are secure, maintainable, and ethical. As AI tools become increasingly 
integrated into software development, the ability to harness them effectively depends on strong 
foundational skills. Engineers must control and guide AI systems, rather than relying on them 
blindly. Their knowledge of software quality and development processes allows them to do this
and sets them apart from casual coders. This module focuses on core competencies such as 
design, testing, security, and ethical AI use, ensuring that engineers maintain full command 
over their tools and decisions. It builds on the basic skills that you should have developed 
already. Some things are therefore assumed and will not be covered directly in the notes or 
practical exercises. These include

* Familiarity with UML diagrams.
* Understanding of software engineering methods such as those covered in [SET08103](https://github.com/edinburgh-napier/SET08103).
* Ability to install and configure software independently.

You are expected to cultivate a proactive, problem-solving mindset and  a desire to develop 
competence as a responsible software engineer. The practical work of the module makes use of 
C# as the main development language; however, this is not a C# training course. Tutorial
materials are proved to get up to speed and to complement materials available elsewhere on the
internet. Professional engineers need to be able to adapt their existing knowledge to new
contexts as technology progresses and being comfortable learning a new language is a key skill.
