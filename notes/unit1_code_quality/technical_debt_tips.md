# Strategies for Managing Technical Debt

Managing and reducing technical debt is essential for maintaining a healthy, maintainable 
codebase and ensuring long-term project success. Applying some of the practices covered 
eslewhere in these notes such as regular refactoring, performing code reviews, the adoption 
of coding standards and adhering to recognised development principles can all help to
eliminate technical debt. However, there are some additional strategies that can be used
once the concept of technical debt has been acknowledged.

1. Prioritize technical debt in backlog

    > Treat technical debt like any other task and include it in the project backlog. 
    > Prioritize addressing high-impact debt that hinders development or creates significant 
    > risks. This ensures that technical debt is acknowledged and managed alongside feature 
    > development.

2. Automated Testing and Continuous Integration

    > Implement comprehensive unit tests, integration tests, and automated testing tools to 
    > catch bugs and regression issues early. This allows developers to refactor with 
    > confidence, knowing that any unintended consequences will be detected.

3. Pay Down Debt Incrementally

    > Just like financial debt, technical debt should be paid down incrementally. Set aside 
    > time in each sprint or development cycle to address technical debt. This prevents it 
    > from becoming overwhelming and keeps the codebase healthy over time.

4. Avoid Quick Fixes and Shortcuts

    > While it’s sometimes necessary to take shortcuts for short-term gains, avoid 
    > consistently prioritizing speed over quality. Whenever a quick fix is applied, plan 
    > to revisit and refactor it when time permits, ensuring the debt is temporary and doesn’t 
    > accumulate.

5. Track and Monitor Debt

    > Use tools to measure and track technical debt (e.g., code complexity, duplication, and 
    > test coverage). Monitoring the level of debt allows the team to identify problem areas 
    > early and plan for remediation.

6. Communicate with Stakeholders

    > Keep stakeholders informed about the impact of technical debt. Clearly explain how 
    > debt affects development speed, feature delivery, and system stability, so that business 
    > decisions account for the long-term health of the codebase.
