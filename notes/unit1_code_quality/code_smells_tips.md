# Practical tips for learning how to stop and correct code smells

1. Learn to Recognize Common Code Smells

    > Familiarize yourself with the most common code smells (e.g., Long Method, Large Class, 
    > Duplicated Code, Feature Envy, etc.).
    > 
    > Start by reading books like 
    > [Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code](https://napier.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/44NAP_INST/n96pef/alma9923667458902111) 
    > by Martin Fowler, which explains code smells in depth. As you code, actively look for 
    > these smells and note where they occur.

2. Refactor Regularly

    > Make refactoring a habit rather than a one-time task. Constantly review your code to 
    > identify areas that need improvement.
    > 
    > Set aside time for small, incremental refactoring during your normal development cycle. 
    > This will help prevent code smells from accumulating over time.

3. Use Code Analysis Tools

    > Leverage static code analysis tools to automatically detect code smells and areas that 
    > may require refactoring.
    > 
    > Tools like SonarQube, ReSharper, or Code Climate can highlight problematic areas in your 
    > code. Integrate these into your development workflow to get real-time feedback on 
    > potential issues.

4. Write Unit Tests Before Refactoring

    > Ensure your code is properly tested before you start refactoring to avoid introducing 
    > bugs.
    > 
    > Write comprehensive unit tests that cover the functionality of the code. This gives you 
    > confidence that your changes (or corrections) wonâ€™t break existing functionality when 
    > you refactor.

5. Follow the Boy Scout Rule

    > Apply the Boy Scout Rule: "Leave the code cleaner than you found it."
    > 
    > Whenever you touch or modify existing code, take the opportunity to clean up nearby 
    > code smells. Even small improvements like renaming variables or simplifying methods 
    > can have a big impact over time.

6. Seek Feedback and Review Code

    > Participate in code reviews and seek feedback from peers to identify code smells and 
    > areas for improvement.
    > 
    > Encourage regular code reviews and ask teammates to look for potential code smells. 
    > Feedback from others can provide new perspectives on improving your code.

7. Minimize Dependencies

    > Avoid tight coupling between classes or modules. Excessive dependencies can create 
    > complex code smells such as Feature Envy or Shotgun Surgery.
    > 
    > Use dependency injection, interfaces, or refactoring techniques like Move Method to 
    > reduce tight coupling between classes and modules. This makes the code easier to change 
    > and extend.

8. Track and Manage Technical Debt

    > Donâ€™t let technical debt accumulate. Code smells are often the first sign of technical 
    > debt building up.
    > 
    > Create a strategy for identifying and prioritizing technical debt. Keep a list of 
    > refactoring tasks in your project backlog and address them regularly.

9. Stay Consistent with Best Practices

    > Consistency is key to maintaining code quality. Stick to best practices, coding standards, 
    > and patterns that prevent the introduction of code smells.
    > 
    > Establish a set of team-wide coding standards and enforce them through code reviews, 
    > tools, and regular team discussions. This helps ensure that code is written in a clean, 
    > maintainable way from the start.
