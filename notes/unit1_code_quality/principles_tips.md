# General Tips for Applying Software Engineering Principles

* Learn the principles
  > You can't apply the rules if you don't know what they are
* Refactor Often
  > Make refactoring part of your regular development process to simplify code and remove duplication.
* Use Code Reviews
  > Encourage regular code reviews with your team to ensure adherence to these principles and to 
  > spot areas of improvement.
* Balance Principles
  > Don’t apply principles in isolation — strike a balance. For example, keep things simple (KISS), 
  > but also ensure that your design adheres to SOLID when necessary.
* Stay Pragmatic
  > Remember that these principles are guidelines, not hard rules. Apply them where they provide 
  > the most benefit and avoid over-engineering solutions in the name of adhering to principles.
* Automate Where Possible
  > Use static analysis tools, linters, and refactoring tools to help identify code smells and 
  > violations of these principles, improving overall code quality.
