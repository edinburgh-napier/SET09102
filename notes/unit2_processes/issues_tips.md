# Practical tips for getting started with issues

1. Understand What an Issue Represents

    > Familiarise yourself with the types of issues 
    > (e.g., bugs, feature requests, tasks, documentation needs) and how they fit into a 
    > project’s workflow.
    > 
    > Browse through the issue tracker of an open-source project on platforms like GitHub or GitLab. 
    > Read through different issues to understand the variety and structure of issues used by development 
    > teams.

2. Learn the Issue Lifecycle

    > Understand the typical lifecycle of an issue, from creation to completion. The lifecycle usually 
    > includes:
    > * Creation: A developer, user, or stakeholder identifies a task, bug, or feature request.
    > * Elaboration: The issue is discussed, clarified, and elaborated to ensure it is well-defined.
    > * Assignment: The issue is assigned to a developer or team member responsible for its resolution.
    > * Implementation: The developer works on resolving the issue.
    > * Review: The work is reviewed by peers or team leads for quality assurance.
    > * Testing: The resolution is tested to ensure the issue is addressed properly.
    > * Closure: The issue is closed once it meets the acceptance criteria and is verified as resolved.
    > 
    > Try creating a simple project and practice this lifecycle by creating an issue, assigning it to 
    > yourself, implementing it, reviewing it, and closing it.

3. Use an Issue Tracker

    > Start using an issue tracker (like GitHub Issues, Jira, or Trello) for your own projects, even 
    > if you're working solo.
    > 
    > Create issues for bugs, new features, or improvements as you work on a project. Break down 
    > larger tasks into smaller issues. This will help you get used to organising your work and 
    > understanding how issues can track the progress of a project.

4. Collaborate on an Open-Source Project

    > Contribute to an open-source project by participating in the issue tracker. Look for 
    > beginner-friendly issues labeled “good first issue” or “help wanted.”
    > 
    > Find an issue in an open-source repository and work on it. Follow its lifecycle from 
    > understanding the problem to submitting a pull request (PR) that resolves it. This will 
    > give you hands-on experience with the collaborative issue process.

5. Understand the Role of Issue Assignment

    > Learn how issues are assigned to team members based on their expertise, availability, or 
    > project priorities.
    > 
    > If working in a team, ask to be assigned issues or volunteer for tasks. Alternatively, on a 
    > solo project, assign issues to yourself to practice issue ownership and responsibility.

6. Pay Attention to Labels and Milestones

    > Get familiar with the use of labels (e.g., bug, feature, priority) and milestones (grouping 
    > issues under larger goals or releases).
    > 
    > Use labels and milestones to categorise and prioritise your issues. For example, mark bugs as 
    > bug or feature requests as enhancement. This helps with organising and filtering tasks.

7. Practice Writing Clear Issues

    > Learn to write clear and well-defined issues that include enough context for others to understand 
    > the problem or task.
    > 
    > When creating an issue, include details such as a description of the problem, steps to reproduce 
    > (for bugs), expected vs. actual behaviour, and any technical details or references. Practice writing 
    > issues that are clear and actionable.

8. Follow Issue Discussions

    > Follow issue discussions in collaborative projects to see how issues evolve over time through 
    > feedback, comments, and updates.
    > 
    > Participate in discussions by leaving comments on issues or reading through the back-and-forth 
    > conversations on open-source project issues. This helps you understand how teams collaborate and 
    > elaborate on problems before they are solved.

9. Track Your Progress

    > Use the issue tracker to monitor your progress. As you work on tasks, regularly update the issue 
    > with comments or status updates.
    > 
    > After working on an issue, add a comment to provide updates or link your commit or pull request. 
    > This helps keep the team informed and makes it easier to track the issue's progress through its 
    > lifecycle.

10. Learn About Pull Requests (PRs) and Issue Linking

    > Understand the relationship between issues and pull requests (PRs), which are used to submit and 
    > review code changes that resolve issues.
    > 
    > When submitting a pull request, link it to the corresponding issue by referencing it in the PR 
    > description (e.g., “Fixes #123” in GitHub). This closes the issue automatically when the PR is 
    > merged, connecting the code change to the task.

11. Use Agile or Kanban Boards

    > If your project uses Agile or Kanban, familiarise yourself with issue boards, where issues are 
    > tracked visually in different stages (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).
    > 
    > Set up a Kanban board for your project and move issues through different stages. This helps you 
    > visualise the issue lifecycle and track project progress more easily.
