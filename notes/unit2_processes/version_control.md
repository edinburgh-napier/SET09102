# Version Control

Version control is a fundamental practice in software development that allows teams and 
individuals to manage changes to code, track its history, and collaborate effectively. It 
provides a structured way to track changes, manage different versions of software, and 
coordinate the efforts of multiple developers. By maintaining a history of changes, version 
control helps developers understand who made modifications, when they were made, and why, 
making it easier to debug, refactor, or revert to previous versions if necessary.

The most widely used version control systems today, such as Git, Subversion (SVN), and 
Mercurial, allow for distributed collaboration, where each developer works independently 
on their own copy of the project. With tools like [GitHub](https://github.com), 
[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product/), 
teams can easily manage branches, pull requests, and code reviews, ensuring that changes are 
properly reviewed and integrated into the main codebase.

Version control also plays a critical role in supporting continuous integration/continuous 
deployment (CI/CD) workflows by enabling automated testing and deployment pipelines. 
Whether working alone or in a large team, version control is an essential tool for 
maintaining the integrity of a codebase, managing collaboration, and ensuring that 
software can evolve efficiently over time.

## Repositories

A code repository, or repo, is a centralized location where software project files and 
their version history are stored and managed. It serves as the backbone of version control 
systems, allowing multiple developers to collaborate on a project while keeping track of 
every change made over time. The main actions a repository supports include committing 
(saving snapshots of changes to the codebase), branching (creating parallel versions of the 
code for new features or experiments), merging (integrating changes from different branches), 
and pulling and pushing (synchronizing local changes with the remote repository). 
Repositories also support pull requests or merge requests, enabling collaborative code 
review and approval before merging changes into the main branch. By maintaining a detailed 
history of changes, a repository helps ensure the integrity of the codebase, facilitates 
collaboration, and provides a mechanism for rolling back to previous versions when necessary.
