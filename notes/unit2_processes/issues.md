# Issues

Issues are a powerful tool for managing tasks, bugs, and feature requests in a software 
project. Mastering the basics of creating, labeling, assigning, and collaborating on issues will 
help you stay organised and contribute effectively to your team. Understanding how to track progress, 
link work, and participate in discussions about issues is essential for any developer working in 
a collaborative environment.

## Issue creation

The lifecycle of an issue tends to follow the pattern shown in Fig. 1. 

![Fig. 1. Issue lifecycle](images/lifecycle_creation.png){: standalone #fig1 data-title="Issue lifecycle"}

Issues are created for various reasons, each helping to track different aspects of the development 
process. During an initial development project to build a software product from scratch, the main 
source of new issues is the initial analysis work that produces a set of user stories. Even in a
development project, though, issues are created in a variety of situations:

<details markdown=1 class="blue-bar">
<summary>Bug reporting</summary>

<p>This occurs when a problem or defect is found in the software, such as when the application doesnâ€™t 
behave as expected. For example, a user might report being unable to log in after a password reset 
or a page might crash when submitting a form.</p>
</details>

<details markdown=1 class="blue-bar">
<summary>Feature requests or enhancements</summary>

<p>Here, developers or stakeholders propose new functionality or improvements to existing features. 
Examples include requests to add a dark mode to the user interface or to improve the performance of 
the search function.</p>
</details>

<details markdown=1 class="blue-bar">
<summary>Technical debt</summary>

<p>This refers to areas of the code that need refactoring or cleanup to improve maintainability. For 
instance, developers might need to refactor the authentication module to improve readability or reduce 
duplicate code in the payment processing system.</p>
</details>

<details markdown=1 class="blue-bar">
<summary>Task management</summary>

<p>These tasks might not involve code changes but are still critical to the project, such as setting up 
a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline or writing documentation for an API.</p>
</details>

<details markdown=1 class="blue-bar">
<summary>Performance issues</summary>

<p>Performance issues track areas where the software may be performing inefficiently and needs 
optimisation, such as improving database query performance for large datasets or optimising image 
loading times on a webpage.</p>
</details>

<details markdown=1 class="blue-bar">
<summary>Security vulnerabilities</summary>

<p>Potential or known flaws that could compromise the system lead to the creation of issues. For 
example, a SQL injection vulnerability might need to be fixed, or stronger password encryption 
might need to be implemented.</p>
</details>

<details markdown=1 class="blue-bar">
<summary>User feedback</summary>

<p>When end users provide suggestions or report problems, developers create issues to track and 
address this feedback. Examples include users requesting the ability to export data as CSV or 
reporting that the interface is not intuitive on mobile devices.</p>
</details>

<details markdown=1 class="blue-bar">
<summary>Testing requirements</summary>

<p>Requirements for unit tests, integration tests, or the performance of user acceptance testing (UAT)
are documented as issues. For example, a developer might create an issue to write unit tests for the 
payment processing module or to perform cross-browser testing on a new feature.</p>
</details>

<details markdown=1 class="blue-bar">
<summary>Infrastructure issues</summary>

<p>These are created when there are problems with the project's infrastructure, such as server downtime, 
configuration errors, or deployment failures. An example might be a server crashing during high 
traffic or a misconfiguration in the database connection string.</p>
</details>

<details markdown=1 class="blue-bar">
<summary>Compliance and legal requirements</summary>

<p>Issues are often used to capture compliance and regulatory requirements, especially when ensuring 
that the software meets regulatory or industry standards. Examples include making sure the system 
complies with GDPR regulations or implementing accessibility features in line with WCAG 2.1 
standards.</p>
</details>

<details markdown=1 class="blue-bar">
<summary>Dependencies</summary>

<p>Projects that depend on third-party libraries or services often track dependency-related issues. 
For example, issues might be created to update a third-party library to its latest version or to 
fix an integration problem with a payment gateway API.</p>
</details>

<details markdown=1 class="blue-bar">
<summary>Version releases</summary>

<p>Issues can be used to track specific tasks that must be completed before a new version is deployed. 
This might include preparing release notes for version 2.0 or fixing critical bugs before version 
1.5 is rolled out.</p>
</details>

## Issue selection

![Fig. 2. Issue selection](images/lifecycle_selection.png){: standalone #fig2 data-title="Issue selection"}

The set of open issues associated with a repository is commonly referred to as the _issue backlog_. 
This term is used to describe all the open issues that need to be addressed, including bugs, feature 
requests, tasks, and other tracked work. The backlog helps teams organise and prioritise the issues 
that are pending resolution. In Agile or Scrum projects, this backlog may be further refined into 
sprints or milestones. Issue selection refers to the process of choosing which issues from the 
backlog will be included in a particular sprint.

## Issue assignment

![Fig. 3. Issue assignment](images/lifecycle_assignment.png){: standalone #fig3 data-title="Issue assignment"}

Issue assignment is the process of designating a specific person or team to be responsible for 
resolving or working on an issue in a software development project. By assigning an issue, the 
project team ensures that someone is accountable for addressing it, which helps organise the 
workload, distribute tasks efficiently, and track progress within the project.

Once an issue is assigned there are some key points to be aware of:

* **Ownership**: When an issue is assigned to a developer or team, it becomes their responsibility 
  to work on resolving the issue, whether it's fixing a bug, developing a new feature, or 
  completing a task.
* **Accountability**: Assignment helps project managers or team leads hold developers accountable 
  for specific tasks, making it easier to track who is responsible for each part of the project.
* **Collaboration**: Issue assignment is often part of collaborative workflows in software 
  development projects, ensuring that tasks are distributed appropriately and no work is overlooked.
* **Tracking**: On platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Jira, an assignee can be tagged within the 
  issue, making it easier to follow up on progress and review updates.

Issues are typically assigned manually by a project maintainer, team lead, or even by developers 
who assign themselves to an issue. Some tools and systems allow for automated issue assignment based 
on predefined rules, like distributing issues evenly among developers or assigning specific types of 
issues to specialised team members. Once an issue is assigned, the responsible developer will usually 
update the issue's status as they work on it, and provide feedback through comments or commits 
linked to the issue.

## Issue elaboration

![Fig. 4. Issue elaboration](images/lifecycle_elaboration.png){: standalone #fig4 data-title="Issue elaboration"}

Issue elaboration refers to the process of expanding and clarifying the details of an issue in a 
software development project to ensure it is well-defined and actionable. This typically involves 
providing a thorough description, context, and specific requirements related to the issue, such as 
the problem it addresses, steps to reproduce a bug, expected behaviour, or technical details for a 
feature request.

The goal of issue elaboration is to ensure that developers, testers, and other stakeholders fully 
understand the scope, requirements, and priority of the issue before any work begins. Well-elaborated 
issues help streamline development by minimising confusion and the need for back-and-forth 
clarifications.

### Issue decomposition

If it becomes clear during issue elaboration that the issue is too large to address in one go,
the developer should break the issue down into smaller, manageable tasks. This process, known as 
_issue decomposition_, helps ensure that each task can be handled independently, improving focus, 
efficiency, and clarity. In such a situation, the developer needs to:

<details markdown=1 class="blue-bar">
<summary>1. Identify the Subtasks</summary>

<p>Break the larger issue into smaller, more manageable subtasks or issues. Each subtask should 
represent a specific, actionable piece of work that can be completed independently.
For example, if the original issue is about building a complex feature, subtasks could be related 
to backend logic, frontend design, database setup, or testing.
</p>
</details>

<details markdown=1 class="blue-bar">
<summary>2. Create New Issues for Each Subtask</summary>

<p>If possible, create separate issues for each subtask. This ensures that each piece of work is 
tracked individually and can be assigned or completed independently.
Clearly label these issues and link them to the original, larger issue to maintain context and 
traceability.
</p>
</details>

<details markdown=1 class="blue-bar">
<summary>3. Update the Original Issue</summary>

<p>Refine the original issue to reflect its new purpose as a "parent" issue or epic that tracks 
the progress of the subtasks.
Include links or references to the newly created subtasks. This helps everyone involved in the 
project understand how the smaller tasks relate to the original, larger goal.
</p>
</details>

<details markdown=1 class="blue-bar">
<summary>4. Prioritise and Estimate the Subtasks</summary>

<p>Once the issue is broken down, each subtask should be prioritised and estimated. Determine 
which tasks are essential or high priority and address them first.
Estimating the time or effort needed for each subtask ensures realistic expectations for completion.
</p>
</details>

<details markdown=1 class="blue-bar">
<summary>5. Collaborate with the Team</summary>

<p>Discuss the decomposition with your team, project manager, or stakeholders. Ensure that everyone 
is aligned on the plan and that subtasks are distributed effectively.
Make sure the scope of each subtask is clear and doesn't overlap unnecessarily with other parts of 
the project.
</p>
</details>

<details markdown=1 class="blue-bar">
<summary>6. Consider Dependencies</summary>

<p>Identify any dependencies between the subtasks. Some tasks may need to be completed before 
others, so establishing a logical order of execution is important.
Document these dependencies in the issue tracker or in the task descriptions.
</p>
</details>

<details markdown=1 class="blue-bar">
<summary>7. Monitor and Track Progress</summary>

<p>As the subtasks are addressed, track the progress of each one individually. The completion of 
all subtasks should lead to the resolution of the original, larger issue.
Use tools like GitHub Milestones, Jira Epics, or Kanban boards to visualise the breakdown and 
progress of the subtasks.
</p>
</details>

As an example, consider an original issue is "Build a User Authentication System". The developer 
might break it down into subtasks like:

* Implement User Registration API
* Implement User Login and Logout
* Set Up Password Recovery
* Integrate Frontend with Authentication API
* Write Unit Tests for User Authentication

Each of these subtasks can be tackled individually, making the overall task more manageable.

### Key Elements of Issue Elaboration

Description:

  > A clear, concise explanation of the issue, including what needs to be done or what problem is 
  > being addressed. For bug reports, this might include the error encountered, while for feature 
  > requests, it might describe the desired functionality.

Steps to Reproduce (for Bugs):

  > A detailed list of steps that can reliably reproduce a bug, ensuring developers can replicate 
  > the issue before fixing it.

Expected vs. Actual Behaviour:

  > A description of the behaviour that is expected compared to what is currently happening, 
  > especially for bug reports.

Technical Specifications:

  > Any technical details required to address the issue, such as dependencies, relevant code 
  > snippets, database structures, or integration points.

Acceptance Criteria:

  > Specific conditions that must be met for the issue to be considered resolved or completed. 
  > These criteria help developers know when their work is done and allow testers to verify the outcome.

Priority and Severity:

    > Information on how critical the issue is to the project. For example, high-priority issues may 
    > require immediate attention, while low-priority ones can be handled later.

Screenshots or Error Logs:

  > Visual aids, error logs, or other supporting materials that provide additional context to help 
  > diagnose or explain the issue.

### Definition of Ready

It is a simple observable fact that the majority of developers like to get started working on
code changes as quickly as possible. However, that is not always the most efficient approach
and it can lead to dead ends, delays and re-work. To counter this, a *Definition of Ready* (DoR)
can be used. Essentially, it is a checklist that defines the criteria for starting on a
development task. The DoR is closely related to the key elements of issue elaboration and might 
include items such as:

* Requirements are clear
* Requirements are testable
* Acceptance criteria are defined
* Dependencies have been identified

A good way to decide whether a development task is ready to be worked on is to use the INVEST
method:

> **Independent**:
> It should be possible to work on a task independently of any other
>
> **Negotiable**:
> A task should not be over-constrained; instead, there should be room for negotiatioon about
> the best way to implement it
>
> **Valuable**:
> The value of the task for the project/client should be clear. This is usually captured by
> acceptance criteria
>
> **Estimable**:
> It should be possible to make a reasonably accurate estimate of the time required for the task.
> If a task is too complex this will be difficult and the task may need splitting.
>
> **Small**:
> (See previous point) Ideally a single task should represent a few person-days of work.
>
> **Testable**:
> Another indication that a task needs to be split is when the tests required are hard to define
> or are very complex.

## Implementation

![Fig. 5. Issue implementation](images/lifecycle_implementation.png){: standalone #fig5 data-title="Issue implementation"}

Software development happens during the implementation stage of the issue lifecycle. the main activities are:

* **Writing the Code**: The core part of issue implementation involves writing or modifying the code to address the 
  issue. For feature requests, this means building new functionality; for bugs, it involves fixing the defect; for 
  technical debt, it may involve refactoring the code.
* **Testing the Solution:** In parallel with writing the code, the developer tests the solution. This could include 
  running unit tests, integration tests, or performing manual tests to ensure the issue has been correctly addressed 
  without introducing new problems.
* **Committing Changes:** A developer should commit changes to the local repository at logical and meaningful points 
  during the development process. Committing regularly helps maintain a clear history of the work being done and 
  provides a way to revert to a previous state if needed. Some commits may mark the end of a logical piece of work, 
  for example, while others may be more preventative such as in advance of a major refactor.

Best practices for committing code includes

* **Making small, frequent commits**: Avoid committing too much at once. Break down your changes into small, 
  manageable pieces to make the history more readable and debugging easier.
* **Writing descriptive commit messages**: Clearly explain the purpose of each commit. Descriptive commit messages 
  make it easier for others (and your future self) to understand what changes were made and why.
* **Avoiding committing broken code**: Try to avoid committing code that doesnâ€™t work or doesnâ€™t pass tests, as 
  this could disrupt the progress of others working on the project.
* **Committing often, but only meaningful changes**: Committing frequently is important, but ensure that each commit 
  represents a logical step forward in the development process.

### Definition of Done

Mirroring the Definition of Ready at the start of the process, the *Definition of Done* (DoD) is a clear and 
shared agreement among a development team on the specific criteria that must be met for a task, feature, or user 
story to be considered complete. It ensures that the work meets the necessary quality standards and is ready for 
release or the next stage of development. An example of a simple DoD might be:

1. **Code Complete**: All code for the task/feature has been written, and no functionality is left unfinished.
2. **Code Reviewed**: The code has been reviewed by at least one other team member and any feedback or suggested 
   changes have been addressed.
3. **Tests Written and Passing**: Unit tests and/or integration tests have been written for the new functionality. 
   All tests pass, and there are no failing or skipped tests.
4. **No Critical Bugs**: The feature has been tested, and no critical bugs or major issues remain. Any existing 
   bugs have been logged and are being tracked for future fixes if not critical.
5. **Meets Acceptance Criteria**: The task or feature meets the original acceptance criteria as defined in the 
   user story or issue.
6. **Documentation Updated**: Any necessary documentation (such as API docs, user guides, or inline comments) has 
   been updated to reflect the new functionality.
7. **Deployed to Test Environment**: The feature has been deployed to the test environment, and QA testing is 
   complete.
8. **Performance Verified**: The feature performs as expected, and there are no significant performance regressions 
   or bottlenecks.

## Review

![Fig. 6. Issue review](images/lifecycle_review.png){: standalone #fig6 data-title="Issue review"}

A review is important when a developer finishes work on an issue because it ensures the quality, correctness, and 
maintainability of the code before it is merged into the main codebase. Code reviews provide an opportunity for peers 
or team members to evaluate the developer's work, identify potential problems, and offer improvements.

Code review is covered in detail in [its own section](code_reviews.md) of these notes.

## Merging

![Fig. 7. Issue merging](images/lifecycle_merge.png){: standalone #fig7 data-title="Issue merging"}

When the development and testing are complete, the code has been reviewed and any points arising from the review
have been dealt with, the updated code can be merged with the rest of the codebase. GitHub and similar platforms
provide functions that automate this process as much as possible, but occasionally there may be a conflict that 
requires attention from a human developer. One of the main techniques for handling this kind of problem is
_branching_ which is covered in [its own section](branching.md) of these notes.


## Summary

In light of the previous sections, two main phases of activity can be identified around
any piece of development work as shown in Fig.8. The time required for each stage depends on the
complexity of the original issue.

![Fig. 8. Development process](images/dev_process.png){: standalone #fig8 data-title="Two-phase development process"}

The rules that a team sets for itself in defining a standard workflow are intended to help
with communication and to avoid errors and conflicts. Although there are examples of good
practice available, there is no gold standard - each team needs to define its own specific
workflow. Some steps are entirely procedural in the sense that they are the responsibility of
the individual developer and cannot be automated. Others are made trivially easy by using the
digital tools available. It must be stressed, however, that the team workflow needs to be
actively managed. If assumptions are made about how team members will behave, serious difficulties
may arise if they do not behave as expected. It is also tempting to try to define a complicated
workflow from the outset in order to keep tight control over the project. This can be
counter-productive, however, making the workflow difficult to understand. A good approach is
often to set up a relatively simple workflow using default or standard options,and then to
introduce changes when it becomes clear that the workflow can be improved.
