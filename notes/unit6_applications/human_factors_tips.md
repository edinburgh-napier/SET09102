# Practical tips for working with external stakeholders

1. Listen First and Take Notes

    > Start by actively listening to stakeholders to understand their goals, priorities, and 
    > concerns. Taking detailed notes during meetings will help you retain information and show 
    > stakeholders that you value their input. Listening first helps you clarify their expectations 
    > before jumping into technical solutions.

2. Ask Clarifying Questions

    > Don’t be afraid to ask questions if something isn’t clear. External stakeholders may not be 
    > familiar with technical jargon, and assumptions can lead to misunderstandings. Asking questions 
    > like “Could you elaborate on that?” or “What does success look like for you?” helps you 
    > gather specifics and ensure you’re on the same page.

3. Simplify Your Language

    > Explain your ideas and solutions in clear, non-technical language. Focus on the purpose and 
    > benefits rather than the technical details unless they ask for specifics. For example, instead 
    > of saying, “We’ll implement an API with an MVC framework,” say, “We’ll create a system that 
    > lets your team retrieve and update data easily.” Simplified language keeps communication clear 
    > and builds trust.

4. Clarify Timelines and Set Realistic Expectations

    > When discussing project timelines, be realistic about what can be achieved within a given 
    > timeframe. Avoid over-promising, as this can lead to disappointment and pressure. Instead, 
    > explain any technical constraints or dependencies that might impact delivery, so stakeholders 
    > understand what’s involved.

5. Be Proactive with Updates

    > Regularly update stakeholders on progress, even if there hasn’t been much change since the 
    > last update. Proactive communication shows accountability and builds confidence. If you hit a 
    > roadblock, let them know early, along with your plan to resolve it. Frequent updates help 
    > stakeholders feel involved and informed.

6. Prepare for Meetings

    > Before each meeting with stakeholders, review their previous feedback, prepare any updates, and 
    > know what questions you may need answered. Being well-prepared shows professionalism and respect 
    > for their time. It also allows you to address their concerns more effectively and keeps 
    > meetings focused.

7. Acknowledge Feedback and Be Open to Suggestions

    > Even if you don’t agree with a suggestion or feedback from a stakeholder, acknowledge it 
    > respectfully. Say things like, “That’s an interesting perspective; let me explore how we 
    > might integrate that.” Showing openness and considering their ideas helps maintain a 
    > collaborative relationship and often leads to a more refined solution.

8. Document Decisions and Action Items

    > After each meeting, summarise the key points, decisions, and action items in a follow-up 
    > email or shared document. Documentation ensures there is a clear, agreed-upon record that 
    > everyone can refer to, reducing the risk of misinterpretation. It also demonstrates your 
    > commitment to accountability and clarity.

9. Balance Technical Constraints with Stakeholder Goals

    > If technical limitations or trade-offs arise, explain these in terms of how they impact the 
    > stakeholder’s goals. For example, instead of saying, “This feature is too resource-intensive,” 
    > explain, “This feature might slow down the system response time. Here are a couple of 
    > alternatives that could achieve a similar outcome.” This approach focuses on their objectives 
    > while guiding them to realistic solutions.

10. Be Empathetic and Patient

    > Recognise that stakeholders may not have a technical background and could find certain aspects 
    > challenging to grasp. Approach interactions with empathy and patience. When a stakeholder seems 
    > frustrated or uncertain, remember that this is often due to the complexity of the project rather 
    > than your work. Showing understanding will strengthen the relationship and make communication 
    > easier.
