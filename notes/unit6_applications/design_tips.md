1. Start with High-Level Design: Define Core System Architecture First

    > Begin by outlining the big picture: decide on the architecture (such as client-server, 
    > microservices, or monolithic) and identify major components, such as databases, external services, 
    > and key modules. This top-down approach provides clarity and helps ensure that your design aligns 
    > with the project’s goals and requirements before diving into detailed code structures.

2. Use Object-Oriented Principles to Guide Your Design

    > Follow object-oriented principles like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. 
    > Design classes to represent real-world entities or logical constructs within your system, grouping 
    > related properties and behaviours. For example, create classes that reflect the entities of your 
    > system, like `User`, `Order`, or `Product`, each with their own attributes and behaviours.

3. Consider the User Journey in Your UX Design

    > Think from the user’s perspective and consider the steps they’ll take to accomplish their goals. 
    > Map out typical user flows for key features, keeping interactions simple and intuitive. For instance, 
    > a sign-up process should be clear and brief, with only essential fields, minimizing user frustration 
    > and improving the overall experience.

4. Consider Future Scalability

    > When designing the system, think about future scaling needs. For instance, if you might need to 
    > add more users or functionality, choose a modular architecture that can grow. This could mean 
    > designing database structures that can be partitioned, or using a microservices approach where 
    > new services can be added independently.

5. Use Design Patterns Wisely

    > Familiarize yourself with common design patterns like `Singleton`, `Factory`, `Observer`, and 
    > `Strategy`. These patterns provide tested solutions to common problems and improve code readability. 
    > However, avoid overusing them; only apply patterns when they clearly benefit the design. For example, 
    > use a `Factory` pattern to create objects when specific subclasses are determined at runtime.

6. Think in Layers for System Structure

    > Divide your system into layers, such as the presentation layer (UI), business logic layer, and data 
    > access layer. This separation of concerns makes it easier to modify or test parts of the system 
    > independently. For instance, if you need to change a database, you only need to update the data layer
    > without altering the UI or business logic.

7. Design for Reusability

    > Aim to design components, classes, and functions that can be reused in different parts of the 
    > system or in future projects. For example, creating a generic API client class or a reusable date 
    > formatting function can save time and reduce redundancy. Reusable code leads to better consistency and 
    > less maintenance in the long term.

8. Document Design Decisions

    > Write down key design decisions, especially if they involve trade-offs or complex logic. 
    > Documenting the reasons behind your choices will help you and others understand the design’s 
    > rationale and make future updates easier. Even a few sentences explaining why a particular pattern 
    > or architecture was chosen can clarify the design for team members or future developers.

9. Prioritize User Feedback in UX Design

    > UX design should make users feel in control and aware of system status. Provide clear feedback 
    > for actions—like loading indicators, success messages, or error notifications. For instance, if a 
    > user submits a form, show a success message or a loading animation to confirm the action, improving 
    > the overall user experience and trust in the system.

10. Consider Edge Cases and Error Handling in Low-Level Design

    > Identify potential edge cases and plan error-handling strategies. For example, think about how 
    > your application should handle network issues, invalid inputs, or unexpected responses from 
    > third-party services. By planning for these scenarios early, you can create a more resilient 
    > system that gracefully handles issues.

11. Focus on Consistency in UI Elements

    > In UX design, consistency is key to an intuitive experience. Use a consistent style for buttons, 
    > colours, fonts, and spacing. When designing forms, follow similar layouts and interaction patterns 
    > throughout the app. A consistent interface allows users to navigate and interact with the system 
    > confidently, reducing their learning curve.

12. Simplify with Encapsulation in Low-Level Design

    > Keep your class internals private whenever possible, exposing only what’s necessary through public 
    > methods. For example, instead of directly exposing a List in a class, provide a method like 
    > `AddItem` or `RemoveItem`. Encapsulation hides complexity and reduces the risk of accidental misuse, 
    > keeping the system’s internal logic clear and controlled.

13. Test Design Assumptions with Early Prototypes

    > Create early, low-fidelity prototypes or wireframes for the UI to test user flows and feature 
    > layouts. On the back end, create minimal implementations of core modules to verify that design 
    > decisions meet the system requirements. Early testing of these prototypes helps identify improvements 
    > and prevents extensive rework later.
