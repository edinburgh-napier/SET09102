# Practical tips for getting started with Test-Driven Development

1. Start with Simple Tests

    > Begin with straightforward, easy-to-test methods, such as mathematical calculations or 
    > simple data manipulations. This will help you get familiar with writing tests and seeing 
    > the Red-Green-Refactor cycle in action without overwhelming complexity. Simple tests are a 
    > good way to build confidence and understand the rhythm of TDD.

2. Embrace the Red-Green-Refactor Cycle

    > Follow the Red-Green-Refactor steps closely: write a test that fails, write just enough 
    > code to make it pass, and then refactor if necessary. Sticking to this cycle keeps you 
    > focused and ensures you write only the necessary code to meet the test’s requirements. 
    > Avoid the temptation to skip any step, especially the “Red” step, as each one serves an 
    > essential purpose.

3. Keep Tests Small and Focused on One Behaviour

    > Write tests that check a single behaviour or functionality. This focus helps you understand 
    > exactly what’s being tested, makes debugging easier, and aligns with TDD’s goal of isolating 
    > units of code. If a method or function has multiple aspects, write separate tests for each 
    > one to keep them manageable and precise.

4. Name Tests Descriptively

    > Use clear and descriptive names for each test so that anyone reading it understands what is 
    > being tested and why. Following a convention like `MethodName_StateUnderTest_ExpectedResult` 
    > (e.g., `Add_TwoPositiveNumbers_ReturnsSum`) helps make the purpose of each test obvious and 
    > improves readability.

5. Write the Simplest Code to Pass Each Test

    > In the “Green” stage, write only the minimum code necessary to make the test pass. This 
    > keeps you from over-engineering or writing unnecessary code. If a feature requires more 
    > complexity, add it gradually by writing additional tests and expanding the code incrementally.

6. Refactor Frequently

    > Refactoring is an integral part of TDD, so use this stage to clean up your code, improve 
    > readability, and simplify logic. Since tests verify that functionality hasn’t changed, you 
    > can refactor with confidence. Small, frequent refactors also keep code clean and maintainable 
    > as it evolves.

7. Use Mocks and Stubs to Isolate Tests

    > When testing code that relies on external dependencies like databases, APIs, or other 
    > services, use mocks or stubs to simulate these dependencies. This isolation keeps your 
    > tests focused on the specific functionality and avoids the overhead of setting up complex 
    > external systems. In C#, for instance, libraries like Moq make mocking easy.

8. Don’t Aim for Perfection on the First Try

    > TDD is an iterative process, so don’t feel pressured to write flawless code immediately. 
    > Write the code that makes the test pass, then improve it gradually through refactoring. 
    > TDD is as much about refining code over time as it is about achieving functionality.

9. Run Tests Frequently

    > Run your tests frequently to catch issues as soon as they occur. Running tests regularly 
    > allows you to address problems in small, manageable increments rather than having to trace 
    > back through a long series of changes.

10. Practice Writing Tests for Edge Cases

    > TDD encourages thinking about different scenarios, including edge cases. Once you’re 
    > comfortable with the basics, consider tests that cover scenarios like invalid inputs, 
    > boundary values, and unexpected states. This practice improves the robustness of your code 
    > and reduces the risk of hidden bugs.

11. Don’t Let TDD Slow You Down

    > TDD has a learning curve, and it’s normal for it to feel slow at first. Focus on learning 
    > the process and following the Red-Green-Refactor cycle without worrying about speed. With 
    > time, TDD will become faster and more natural, and you’ll experience its benefits in 
    > catching bugs early and maintaining high-quality code.

12. Celebrate Small Wins

    > Completing each test and making it pass is a small victory, so take a moment to appreciate 
    > each successful cycle. This positive reinforcement helps build confidence in your TDD skills 
    > and makes the process more enjoyable.
