# Practical tips for getting started with Behaviour-Driven Development

1. Start Small and Focus on Key Behaviours

    > Begin with a few high-priority features and define the most important behaviours for each. 
    > Don’t try to write scenarios for every detail right away—focus on behaviours that are most 
    > critical to the user experience and business goals. As you become more comfortable with BDD, 
    > you can expand to cover additional behaviours.

2. Collaborate Actively with Stakeholders

    > BDD relies on collaboration, so involve stakeholders, product owners, and testers in the 
    > process. Use initial meetings to gather feedback and refine scenarios together. Ask 
    > stakeholders for input on what they expect from the feature and how they envision it 
    > functioning, then translate these insights into BDD scenarios. Open communication early 
    > on can help you create more meaningful tests and avoid misunderstandings.

3. Write Scenarios in Simple, Clear Language

    > Use straightforward, human-readable language to write your scenarios. The Given-When-Then 
    > format should describe the behaviour in terms that non-technical team members can understand. 
    > Avoid technical jargon, and keep each scenario focused on one behaviour. Well-written 
    > scenarios help bridge the gap between technical and non-technical team members, making it 
    > easier for everyone to understand and validate the feature.

4. Focus on One Scenario at a Time

    > Tackle one scenario at a time and work through it completely before moving on to the next. 
    > This allows you to focus on the specifics of each behaviour, helping you ensure that each 
    > part of the feature functions as expected. Trying to implement multiple scenarios 
    > simultaneously can lead to confusion and make it harder to track down issues if something 
    > doesn’t work as intended.

5. Use BDD Tools to Automate Your Scenarios

    > Familiarise yourself with BDD tools like Cucumber or SpecFlow to automate your scenarios. 
    > These tools support the Given-When-Then format and make it easier to manage scenarios in a 
    > format that’s both executable and human-readable. Use the tools to link scenarios to specific 
    > code, allowing you to run tests automatically and validate each behaviour as development 
    > progresses.

6. Avoid Overly Detailed Scenarios

    > BDD scenarios are most effective when they describe the “what” of behaviour rather than the 
    > “how.” Avoid including implementation details in scenarios, as this can make them more 
    > complex and harder to understand. Instead, focus on what the user or system should 
    > experience, leaving the underlying implementation flexible. Scenarios should be high-level 
    > descriptions of expected outcomes rather than step-by-step instructions.

7. Organise Scenarios into Logical Groups

    > Keep scenarios organised by grouping them by feature or user story. This organisation helps 
    > make scenarios easier to navigate and ensures that they reflect the system’s structure. 
    > Well-organised scenarios also make it easier to communicate progress to stakeholders and 
    > track development of different features.

8. Keep Scenarios Short and Focused on Expected Outcomes

    > Aim for each scenario to address one clear behaviour or outcome. Short, focused scenarios 
    > are easier to understand, test, and maintain. They also help prevent overlapping behaviours, 
    > which can cause confusion. For instance, a scenario that tests a successful login should 
    > not also check for incorrect password handling—these should be two separate scenarios.

9. Review and Refine Scenarios Regularly

    > As requirements evolve, revisit and refine scenarios to reflect new insights or changing 
    > priorities. BDD is iterative, so keep your scenarios up-to-date and ensure they accurately 
    > represent the current expectations. Regular review sessions with stakeholders help ensure 
    > that scenarios stay relevant and aligned with business goals.

10. Use Mocks for External Dependencies

    > If your scenarios involve dependencies like databases or external services, use mocks or 
    > stubs to simulate these dependencies. This keeps your BDD tests fast and reliable, 
    > especially for scenarios that need to be run frequently. Tools like Moq (in .NET) can help 
    > you set up mocks easily, allowing you to focus on the behaviour without setting up complex 
    > infrastructure.
