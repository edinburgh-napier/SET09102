# Testing

<blockquote class="pretty"><span>
Code without tests is bad code. It doesn't matter how well written it is; it doesn't matter how pretty or object-oriented or well-encapsulated it is. With tests, we can change the behavior of our code quickly and verifiably. Without them, we really don't know if our code is getting better or worse.

In Agile development, testing plays a crucial role in ensuring the quality, reliability, and 
continuous improvement of software. Unlike traditional development models where testing is conducted 
only at the end of the development cycle, Agile integrates testing throughout the entire process. 
Testing is woven into every sprint, enabling early detection of defects, continuous feedback, and 
alignment with rapidly evolving requirements. This iterative, collaborative approach to testing 
helps Agile teams maintain a steady pace of delivery without sacrificing quality, as each feature 
or function is verified immediately after development.

Agile testing practices, such as Test-Driven Development (TDD), Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), 
and automated regression testing, support the agile goal of delivering functional, high-quality 
increments in short cycles. By testing early and often, Agile teams can respond quickly to changes, 
fix issues before they compound, and ensure that the product remains stable and usable as it 
evolves. Testing in Agile isn’t just the responsibility of dedicated testers; it’s a collaborative 
effort involving developers, testers, and sometimes even stakeholders, who contribute to defining 
and validating requirements.
