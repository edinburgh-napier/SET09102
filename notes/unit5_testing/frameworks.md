# Testing Frameworks

Software testing frameworks are structured tools and environments designed to support, simplify, 
and automate the testing process for software applications. These frameworks provide a standard way 
to define, organize, execute, and report tests, making it easier for development teams to maintain 
high-quality code and ensure that applications meet functional and performance requirements. By 
using a testing framework, developers and testers can create efficient, reusable test cases and 
automate repetitive testing tasks, significantly reducing manual effort and minimizing human error.

Testing frameworks are essential for implementing different types of tests, such as unit, 
integration, end-to-end, and regression tests. They offer features like test case management, 
assertions to verify expected behavior, test data handling, and reporting. Most frameworks also 
support integration with Continuous Integration (CI) tools, making it possible to run tests 
automatically with every code change, thus helping to catch issues early in the development process.

Choosing the right testing framework depends on the programming language, project requirements, 
and type of testing needed. Some popular examples include 
[JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/) and [TestNG](https://testng.org/) for Java, 
[MSTest](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/testing/unit-testing-with-mstest) and 
[xUnit](https://xunit.net/) for C#,
[pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) for Python, and 
[Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) for JavaScript. 
These frameworks often come with extensive libraries, plugins, and community support, helping 
teams to tailor the framework to their specific needs.

## Essential concepts

Software testing frameworks revolve around providing a structured, efficient approach to 
creating, managing, and executing tests in software development. These frameworks define a 
standard format for writing test cases and include tools to organize, execute, and report results. 
Core concepts include:

* **Test Case Definition**: Frameworks provide structured ways to define test cases, including 
  setting up initial conditions, specifying inputs, and establishing expected outcomes using 
  assertions.
* **Automation Support**: Testing frameworks enable the automation of tests, which reduces manual 
  effort, increases test reliability, and supports continuous testing through integration with 
  CI/CD pipelines.
* **Test Suite Organization**: They help organize tests into groups or suites, allowing developers 
  to categorize tests based on function, scope (unit, integration, end-to-end), or feature area, 
  making it easier to manage and maintain tests over time.
* **Assertions and Verification**: Frameworks include assertion libraries that check whether test 
  outputs match expected results, ensuring that code behaves as intended under different conditions.
* **Setup and Teardown Functions**: Frameworks often provide setup and teardown methods that run 
  before and after each test or test suite, preparing the environment or cleaning up resources to 
  ensure test isolation and reliability.
* **Reporting and Logging**: Detailed reports and logs provided by testing frameworks give insights 
  into test outcomes, highlighting passing and failing tests to help teams quickly identify and 
  debug issues.
* **Cross-Platform and Language Support**: Many frameworks are language-specific but are often 
  designed to support cross-platform execution, allowing tests to be run across different operating 
  systems and environments.

## Assertions

In all testing frameworks, assertions are used to verify that the outcome of a test matches the 
expected result. These assertions form the basis of unit testing, providing feedback on whether 
the code behaves as intended. Here are some common assertions in xUnit, a common framework for 
.NET, along with examples of their usage.

1. **`Assert.Equal`**

    This assertion checks if two values are equal. It’s typically used for verifying that a method 
    returns the correct result.
    
    ```c#
    [Fact]
    public void Add_ReturnsCorrectSum()
    {
        // Arrange
        int a = 3;
        int b = 2;
        int expected = 5;
        var calculator = new Calculator();
    
        // Act
        int result = calculator.Add(a, b);
    
        // Assert
        Assert.Equal(expected, result);
    }
    ```

> Note the use of the `[Fact]` attribute which defines a test method in xunit. Any method 
> marked with `[Fact]` is considered a test case by xUnit and will be executed by the test 
> runner. Tests with the `[Fact]` attribute do not take parameters and are typically used for 
> straightforward, independent tests. For parameterised tests, the `[Theory]` attribute is
> used in conjunction with the `[InlineData]` attribute which supplies the test data as in the
> below.
> ```c#
> [Theory]
> [InlineData(2, 3, 5)]
> [InlineData(-1, 1, 0)]
> [InlineData(0, 0, 0)]
> public void Add_ReturnsCorrectSum_ForVariousInputs(int a, int b, int expected)
> {
>     var calculator = new Calculator();
>     int result = calculator.Add(a, b);
>     Assert.Equal(expected, result);
> }
> ```
> For more information about attributes, please refer to the 
> [xunit documentation](https://xunit.net/docs/comparisons).


2. **`Assert.NotEqual`**

    This assertion checks that two values are not equal. It can be useful when ensuring that an 
    operation returns an unexpected result under certain conditions.
    
    ```c#
    [Fact]
    public void Add_DoesNotReturnIncorrectSum()
    {
        // Arrange
        int a = 3;
        int b = 2;
        int incorrectResult = 6;
        var calculator = new Calculator();
    
        // Act
        int result = calculator.Add(a, b);
    
        // Assert
        Assert.NotEqual(incorrectResult, result);
    }
    ```

3. **`Assert.True` / `Assert.False`**

    These assertions check if a condition is true or false, respectively. They’re useful for 
    validating boolean results or conditions within your tests.
    
    ```c#
    [Fact]
    public void IsAdult_ReturnsTrueForAge18OrMore()
    {
        // Arrange
        int age = 20;
        var user = new User { Age = age };
    
        // Act
        bool result = user.IsAdult();
    
        // Assert
        Assert.True(result);
    }
    
    [Fact]
    public void IsAdult_ReturnsFalseForAgeBelow18()
    {
        // Arrange
        int age = 16;
        var user = new User { Age = age };
    
        // Act
        bool result = user.IsAdult();
    
        // Assert
        Assert.False(result);
    }
    ```

4. **`Assert.Null` / `Assert.NotNull`**

    These assertions verify whether an object is null or not null. They’re useful for testing 
    methods that return optional values, objects that may not be initialized, or error handling 
    scenarios.
    
    ```c#
    [Fact]
    public void GetUser_ReturnsNullForNonexistentUserId()
    {
        // Arrange
        int userId = 999;
        var userService = new UserService();
    
        // Act
        var user = userService.GetUser(userId);
    
        // Assert
        Assert.Null(user);
    }
    
    [Fact]
    public void GetUser_ReturnsUserObjectForExistingUserId()
    {
        // Arrange
        int userId = 1;
        var userService = new UserService();
    
        // Act
        var user = userService.GetUser(userId);
    
        // Assert
        Assert.NotNull(user);
    }
    ```
    
5. **`Assert.Contains` / `Assert.DoesNotContain`**

    These assertions are used to verify if a collection contains a specific item or not. They’re 
    helpful when validating results in lists or arrays.
    
    ```c#
    [Fact]
    public void GetAllUsers_ContainsSpecificUser()
    {
        // Arrange
        var userService = new UserService();
        var expectedUser = new User { Id = 1, Name = "Alice" };
    
        // Act
        var users = userService.GetAllUsers();
    
        // Assert
        Assert.Contains(expectedUser, users);
    }
    ```
    
6. **`Assert.Throws`**

    This assertion checks if a specific exception is thrown, which is useful for testing error 
    handling and edge cases.
    
    ```c#
    [Fact]
    public void Withdraw_ThrowsExceptionForInsufficientFunds()
    {
        // Arrange
        var account = new BankAccount();
        account.Deposit(100);
    
        // Act & Assert
        Assert.Throws<InvalidOperationException>(() => account.Withdraw(200));
    }
    ```

7. **`Assert.Empty` / `Assert.NotEmpty`**

    These assertions verify if a collection is empty or not empty. They are useful for checking 
    whether a method correctly returns an empty list or adds items to a collection.
    
    ```c#
    [Fact]
    public void GetUserTransactions_ReturnsEmptyListForNewAccount()
    {
        // Arrange
        var account = new BankAccount();
    
        // Act
        var transactions = account.GetUserTransactions();
    
        // Assert
        Assert.Empty(transactions);
    }
    
    [Fact]
    public void GetUserTransactions_ReturnsNonEmptyListAfterDeposit()
    {
        // Arrange
        var account = new BankAccount();
        account.Deposit(100);
    
        // Act
        var transactions = account.GetUserTransactions();
    
        // Assert
        Assert.NotEmpty(transactions);
    }
