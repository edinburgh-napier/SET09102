# Behaviour-Driven Development

Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) is an agile software development technique that extends the 
principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD) by emphasising collaboration between developers, 
testers, and non-technical stakeholders to define the desired behaviour of an application. In BDD, 
development begins by defining the expected behaviours of a system in a shared, human-readable 
format that both technical and non-technical team members can understand. This approach bridges 
the gap between business requirements and technical implementation, ensuring that the software 
delivers real value and meets user needs.

BDD typically employs a "Given-When-Then" format to describe scenarios, using language that 
expresses system behaviour from the user’s perspective. For example, "Given a user has an active 
account, when they log in with correct credentials, then they should be redirected to their 
dashboard". These specifications are often written in a language like 
[Gherkin](https://automationpanda.com/bdd/), which allows business stakeholders to read and 
understand the behaviour-driven scenarios alongside developers.

In BDD, tests are derived directly from these scenarios, making them accessible and meaningful to 
everyone involved in the project. This shared understanding reduces miscommunication, aligns the 
team with business objectives, and fosters collaboration. The focus is on specifying what the 
system should do rather than how it should do it. BDD test scenarios become living documentation 
for the system’s behaviour, clarifying functionality and expectations as the product evolves.

## BDD and TDD compared

While BDD builds upon the principles of TDD, there are key distinctions in focus, scope, and process.

| Aspect  | TDD                                                                                                                                  | BDD                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Focus   | TDD focuses on verifying specific units of functionality through unit tests, which test the internal mechanics of a feature.         | BDD is concerned with the overall behaviour of the system as it aligns with user stories and business requirements. TDD emphasises making small units of code work correctly, whereas BDD emphasises ensuring that the system’s behaviour matches user expectations. |
| Scope   | In TDD, developers write unit tests for individual methods and functions, which ensures isolated parts of the system work correctly. | BDD focuses on end-to-end scenarios that describe user interactions with the system. While TDD tests verify isolated pieces of logic, BDD scenarios test complete behaviours, making it easier to see the impact on the overall user experience.                     |
| Process | TDD is primarily a developer-centered approach, with test cases typically written in code.                                           | BDD encourages collaboration between developers, QA, and business stakeholders by creating test cases in a common language that everyone can understand. This collaboration promotes shared ownership and ensures that development aligns with business goals.       |

While TDD typically uses unit testing frameworks like JUnit or NUnit, BDD often uses tools 
specifically designed for behaviour-driven development, such as [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) 
for Java or [SpecFlow](https://specflow.org/) for .NET. These tools support the Given-When-Then 
structure and can integrate with Gherkin syntax to create human-readable specifications that double 
as executable tests.

## Example of BDD in C# with SpecFlow

Consider a login feature for a user portal. Using SpecFlow and the Given-When-Then structure, we 
can write a BDD scenario for this behaviour in a Gherkin file, such as `Login.feature`.

``` gherkin
Feature: User Login
  As a user of the portal
  I want to be able to log in to my account
  So that I can access my personal dashboard

  Scenario: Successful login
    Given a user with username "Alice" and password "password123"
    When the user attempts to log in with correct credentials
    Then the user should be redirected to the dashboard
```

This scenario describes the behaviour in a language that both developers and stakeholders can 
understand. The developer then implements step definitions in C# to link this specification with 
the application logic:

``` c#
[Binding]
public class LoginSteps
{
    private readonly UserPortal _portal;
    private bool _loginSuccessful;

    public LoginSteps(UserPortal portal)
    {
        _portal = portal;
    }

    [Given(@"a user with username ""(.*)"" and password ""(.*)""")]
    public void GivenAUserWithUsernameAndPassword(string username, string password)
    {
        _portal.CreateUser(username, password);
    }

    [When(@"the user attempts to log in with correct credentials")]
    public void WhenTheUserAttemptsToLogInWithCorrectCredentials()
    {
        _loginSuccessful = _portal.Login("Alice", "password123");
    }

    [Then(@"the user should be redirected to the dashboard")]
    public void ThenTheUserShouldBeRedirectedToTheDashboard()
    {
        Assert.True(_loginSuccessful);
        Assert.True(_portal.IsUserOnDashboard());
    }
}
```

In this example, each step of the scenario links directly to a method in C#, where behaviour can 
be tested. The test steps directly reflect the initial requirements, ensuring that the application 
behaves as stakeholders expect. This clarity fosters communication across the team, as the behaviour 
scenarios are easy to read and understand, creating a shared language for discussing requirements.

## Critique of BDD

BDD provides numerous advantages, particularly in complex or customer-focused projects. The 
collaborative approach helps prevent misunderstandings and clarifies requirements early in the 
development process, making it less likely that developers build the wrong functionality. BDD 
also emphasies the user experience, as test scenarios are written from the user’s perspective, 
leading to more user-centric designs. Finally, BDD scenarios become living documentation that 
can be easily maintained and updated, ensuring that everyone has a clear view of the system’s 
behaviour and requirements.

One of the main critiques of BDD is that it requires a high level of discipline and collaboration 
between stakeholders, developers, and QA teams. For BDD to be effective, all parties need to be 
actively involved in defining scenarios, which can be difficult to achieve in teams where 
communication is limited or stakeholders are less engaged. BDD’s collaborative process is ideal 
for companies with a culture of open communication, but in more siloed environments, it may be 
difficult to bring everyone together consistently for behaviour definition and refinement.

Another limitation of BDD is its dependency on clear, stable requirements. BDD scenarios are based 
on behaviours derived from user stories, so if requirements are not well-defined or are subject to 
frequent change, the process can become cumbersome. When requirements are unstable, teams may end 
up spending significant time rewriting scenarios to keep them in sync with the latest expectations. 
This is particularly challenging in fast-paced or highly exploratory projects, where new insights 
and requirements evolve frequently. In such cases, BDD can feel like an overhead rather than an 
asset, as the behaviour definitions and test scenarios require constant maintenance.

Additionally, BDD scenarios are often written in a human-readable syntax like Gherkin, which aims 
to make tests understandable to both technical and non-technical team members. However, in practice, 
it can be difficult to write scenarios that are genuinely meaningful to non-technical stakeholders. 
If scenarios become too technical or involve implementation details, they lose their accessibility, 
which diminishes the primary benefit of BDD. Writing high-quality, business-focused scenarios in 
Gherkin requires practice, and even then, it can be challenging to keep them simple enough for 
everyone while detailed enough to be valuable for development and testing.

BDD can also lead to an over-focus on scenario coverage rather than holistic testing. Because BDD 
scenarios aim to cover specific behaviours, there is a risk of missing edge cases or unusual paths 
that may not be considered in initial scenarios. This narrow focus on "expected" behaviours can leave 
gaps in test coverage, especially in complex systems where real-world usage can involve unexpected 
combinations of user actions or inputs. To address this, BDD typically needs to be supplemented 
with other forms of testing, which can increase the testing load.

Finally, tooling complexity can be a hurdle in BDD. While tools like Cucumber and SpecFlow 
facilitate BDD by supporting behaviour specification and test automation, these tools come with 
their own learning curves and maintenance requirements. The technical overhead involved in 
managing BDD scenarios and ensuring they are consistently up-to-date can add complexity, 
especially in large teams or projects. New team members or stakeholders unfamiliar with BDD 
may struggle to understand the process, requiring additional training and time investments.

In summary, while BDD provides value by aligning development with business needs and fostering 
communication, it is not universally applicable or easy to adopt. BDD works best in projects with 
clear requirements, stable goals, and a high level of stakeholder involvement. When these 
conditions aren’t met, BDD can add complexity and maintenance overhead without delivering its 
intended benefits. For organisations considering BDD, it’s essential to weigh the collaboration 
and scenario-writing costs against the value it provides to ensure that BDD is a good fit for 
the project’s context and team structure.
