# External Quality

## External quality criteria

Quality is a very difficult concept to pin down with a definition.
[SEVOCAB](https://pascal.computer.org/) offers three versions from different
sources:

> ### **quality**
>
> (1) degree to which the system satisfies the stated and implied needs of its
> various stakeholders, and thus provides value
> ([ISO/IEC 25010](https://napier.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/44NAP_INST/19n0mho/cdi_bsi_primary_000000000030215101))
>
> (2) ability of a product, service, system, component, or process to meet customer
> or user needs, expectations, or requirements
> ([ISO/IEC/IEEE 24765](https://napier.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/44NAP_INST/19n0mho/cdi_bsi_primary_000000000030413573))
>
> (3) the degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfils the requirements
> ([PMBOK](https://napier.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/44NAP_INST/n96pef/alma9923796446002111))

All of these definitions focus on the final product from the point of view of the
customer. In that sense, quality can only be evaluated with reference to the
*external properties* of the system which include, for example:

* **Reliability**:
  The degree to which a system, product or component performs specified functions
  under specified conditions for a specified period of time
  ([ISO/IEC 25010](https://napier.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/44NAP_INST/19n0mho/cdi_bsi_primary_000000000030215101))
* **Security**:
  Protection against intentional subversion or forced failure
  ([ISO/IEC 15288](https://napier.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/44NAP_INST/19n0mho/cdi_bsi_primary_000000000030433813))
* **Maintainability**:
  The degree of effectiveness and efficiency with which a product or system can be
  modified by the intended maintainers
  ([ISO/IEC 25010](https://napier.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/44NAP_INST/19n0mho/cdi_bsi_primary_000000000030215101))
* **Portability**:
  The ease with which a system or component can be transferred from one hardware or
  software environment to another
  ([ISO/IEC 24765](https://napier.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/44NAP_INST/19n0mho/cdi_bsi_primary_000000000030346267))
* **Usability**:
  The degree to which a product or system can be used by specified users to achieve
  specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified
  context of use
  ([ISO/IEC 25010](https://napier.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/44NAP_INST/19n0mho/cdi_bsi_primary_000000000030215101))

External properties describe the operation of the whole system and therefore need
to be evaluated at the system level. That is, the system has to be tested in use.
This system-level testing is explicitly captured in the
[V life cycle model](../unit3_agile/Week03a_lifecycle.md#the-v-model) where it is paired with the
analysis phase of the waterfall. This type of quality testing is relevant for any
software development project including those that use an agile approach. The
derivation of external quality criteria and their evaluation is discussed in more
detail in the [requirements modelling](Week11a_requirements_modelling.md) section.
