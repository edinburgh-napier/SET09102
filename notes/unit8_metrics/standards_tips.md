# Practical tips for working with quality standards

1. Understand Core Quality Characteristics

    > Start by familiarising yourself with the key quality attributes outlined in standards like ISO 25000, 
    > such as functionality, performance, maintainability, and security. Each attribute represents a specific 
    > area that impacts the software's overall quality and user satisfaction. Recognising these characteristics 
    > helps you align your coding and design practices with recognised quality goals.

2. Set Clear Quality Objectives

    > When working on a new project or feature, set specific goals for each quality characteristic. For example, 
    > aim to meet response time benchmarks for performance, or adhere to secure coding practices for security. 
    > Clear objectives provide a focus and allow you to measure progress against standards throughout development.

3. Incorporate Standards into Daily Workflows

    > Make quality standards part of your daily development practices. Use tools like static code analysers for 
    > maintainability and performance tests to check efficiency. When writing code, periodically review it with 
    > a focus on these quality benchmarks, ensuring it aligns with established standards.

4. Learn to Use Quality Metrics

    > Quality standards often involve specific metrics, such as response time for performance or error rates for 
    > functionality. Familiarise yourself with these metrics and tools that can help you measure them, such as 
    > SonarQube for maintainability and security or benchmarking tools for performance testing.

5. Prioritise Documentation and Readability

    > Maintainability is a key aspect of quality, and readable, well-documented code is crucial. Adopt a clear 
    > and consistent coding style, add inline comments where needed, and use external documentation to explain 
    > complex logic. This practice not only helps others understand your work but also aligns with quality standards.

6. Incorporate Continuous Testing

    > To meet quality standards, testing should be an ongoing process. Run unit tests, integration tests, and 
    > performance tests as you code to catch issues early. Continuous testing ensures your work is on track with 
    > quality objectives, making it easier to meet standard benchmarks in the final product.

7. Use Code Reviews to Evaluate Against Standards

    > When participating in code reviews, evaluate not only for functionality but also for compliance with 
    > quality standards like security and performance. This peer feedback loop helps reinforce best practices 
    > and keeps the code aligned with quality goals.

8. Stay Informed on Standards Updates

    > Quality standards evolve, so stay updated on changes or new practices introduced by bodies like ISO. 
    > Following updates can provide insights into emerging quality expectations, allowing you to improve your 
    > approach and apply the latest best practices.
