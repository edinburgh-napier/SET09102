# Practical tips for applying external quality criteria

1. Align with Stakeholder Needs

    > Ensure you understand both stated and implied requirements from stakeholders early in the project. 
    > Collaborate with product managers, UX/UI designers, and end-users to clarify expectations and 
    > requirements, ensuring the system meets real-world needs and delivers value.

2. Prioritise Usability and User Experience

    > External quality often involves usability. Design intuitive interfaces and test for ease of navigation 
    > and accessibility. Performing user testing throughout development helps identify potential pain points 
    > early and ensures that the software meets user expectations.

3. Focus on Performance Benchmarks

    > Define performance criteria (such as response time and load capacity) that align with user expectations. 
    > Use performance testing tools to validate that your code meets these requirements, especially under load 
    > conditions, to maintain a smooth and responsive user experience.

4. Implement Reliability and Resilience Measures

    > Reliability is crucial to external quality. Incorporate error handling and failover mechanisms to manage 
    > unexpected events gracefully, and conduct regular stress and load testing to confirm system stability 
    > under various conditions.

5. Ensure Security Compliance

    > Many external quality standards include security as a core aspect. Identify security requirements 
    > relevant to your system (such as data encryption and secure authentication) and implement them early. 
    > Conduct regular security assessments to confirm your software meets compliance and safeguards user data.

6. Regularly Review and Validate Requirements

    > External quality is tied to fulfilling user and stakeholder expectations. Conduct regular reviews with 
    > stakeholders to validate that ongoing development aligns with both functional and non-functional 
    > requirements, allowing for adjustments before release.

7. Test Across Environments

    > Since external quality criteria often relate to deployment environments, test the software in diverse 
    > environments (e.g., different devices, browsers, operating systems). This helps identify potential issues 
    > that could affect user experience on varying platforms.

8. Document Quality Requirements and Metrics

    > Record quality requirements (like usability, performance, and reliability) and associated metrics. 
    > Tracking these metrics helps you evaluate if the software meets external quality criteria and provides 
    > a basis for continuous improvement.
