## Requirements Elicitation Tips

1. Engage with Stakeholders Early and Often

    > Identify key stakeholders—such as end-users, product owners, and business analysts—early in the 
    > project and build a communication plan to stay engaged with them. Their insights are crucial to 
    > understanding needs, priorities, and constraints.
    > 
    > Failing to engage all relevant stakeholders can lead to incomplete requirements, as important 
    > perspectives might be missed.

2. Ask Open-Ended Questions

    > Use open-ended questions to explore what users truly need, rather than what they think they want. 
    > For example, instead of asking, “Do you need a report function?” ask, “How would you like to view 
    > or analyse your data?”
    > 
    > Avoid leading questions, as they can bias stakeholders toward specific solutions and result in 
    > inaccurate requirements.

3. Use Multiple Elicitation Techniques

    > Combine methods like interviews, workshops, surveys, observations, and brainstorming sessions to 
    > gather requirements from various angles. Different methods provide different insights and help 
    > build a comprehensive view.
    > 
    > Relying solely on one technique (e.g., interviews) may limit the quality and breadth of 
    > information gathered.

4. Document Everything Carefully

    > Take detailed notes and document all requirements gathered, including assumptions, constraints, 
    > and any open questions. Visual aids like use cases or user stories can help make requirements 
    > clearer.
    > 
    > Failing to document requirements thoroughly can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunication 
    > later in the project.

5. Validate Requirements with Stakeholders

    > After each elicitation session, confirm your understanding of the requirements with 
    > stakeholders. Summarise what was discussed and ask for feedback to ensure accuracy.
    > 
    > Assuming that you’ve understood requirements without validation can lead to incorrect 
    > assumptions, resulting in a product that doesn’t meet user needs.

6. Focus on the Problem, Not the Solution

    > Concentrate on understanding the problem the user is facing rather than jumping to specific 
    > solutions. This encourages creativity in finding the best solution during the design phase.
    > 
    > Prematurely committing to a solution can limit flexibility and lead to a product that might 
    > not fully solve the user’s problem.

## Requirements Analysis Tips

1. Organise and Prioritise Requirements

    > Categorise requirements into functional, non-functional, and technical requirements. Prioritise 
    > them based on factors like business value, feasibility, and dependencies to focus on the most 
    > critical features first.
    > 
    > Treating all requirements as equally important can lead to scope creep and dilute focus on core 
    > functionality.

2. Identify Ambiguities and Clarify Language

    > Look for ambiguous terms (e.g., “easy to use,” “fast,” “secure”) in requirements and clarify 
    > them with measurable criteria. Clearly defined language prevents misinterpretation during 
    > implementation.
    > 
    > Overlooking vague language can lead to different interpretations of the same requirement 
    > among developers, testers, and stakeholders, creating confusion.

3. Analyse Feasibility and Constraints

    > Assess the feasibility of each requirement by considering technical, financial, and time 
    > constraints. Involve technical experts to evaluate whether requirements are realistic and 
    > achievable.
    > 
    > Failing to evaluate feasibility may lead to unrealistic commitments or delays later in 
    > development if certain requirements prove unachievable.

4. Manage Dependencies and Conflicts

    > Identify dependencies between requirements and address conflicts early. For example, if two 
    > requirements depend on different technologies, find ways to harmonise them before development 
    > starts.
    > 
    > Ignoring dependencies or conflicts can cause issues during implementation, as dependent 
    > requirements might impact each other’s functionality or performance.

5. Create Prototypes or Mockups Where Possible

    > Use prototypes, wireframes, or mockups to visually represent complex requirements. These 
    > tools help stakeholders better understand the requirements and provide more actionable feedback.
    > 
    > Relying solely on written requirements may lead to misunderstandings, as stakeholders might 
    > interpret written descriptions differently.

6. Establish Acceptance Criteria

    > Define clear, measurable acceptance criteria for each requirement to guide developers and 
    > testers. Acceptance criteria should describe how the functionality will be evaluated to confirm 
    > it meets the requirement.
    > 
    > Omitting acceptance criteria or leaving them vague can lead to disagreements during testing 
    > and sign-off, as stakeholders may have different expectations.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

* **Scope Creep:** Keep a close watch on new or modified requirements that arise during the 
  project. Use a formal change management process to control scope and avoid unnecessary 
  additions that don’t add value.

* **Analysis Paralysis:** Requirements analysis should be thorough but time-limited. Spending 
  too much time perfecting requirements without progressing to development can delay the project. 
  Strike a balance between detail and forward momentum.

* **Ignoring Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs):** Address performance, usability, scalability, 
  security, and other non-functional requirements early. NFRs can impact system architecture 
  and user experience significantly.

* **Failing to Involve End Users:** Involve actual end users, not just business stakeholders, 
  in elicitation and validation. End users often have insights that other stakeholders might 
  overlook.
