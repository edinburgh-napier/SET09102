# Practical tips for using structured software development methods

1. Clear and Stable Requirements

    > If the project has well-defined, unchanging requirements from the outset, structured 
    > methodologies like Waterfall or V-Model are suitable. These methods work best when there is 
    > little risk of requirements evolving mid-project, as changes are difficult to accommodate later 
    > in the development process.

2. Strict Regulatory Compliance

    > In industries with strict compliance and regulatory requirements (e.g., healthcare, finance, 
    > aerospace), structured methodologies are ideal due to their emphasis on documentation and 
    > traceability. If the project involves significant regulatory oversight, choose a structured 
    > approach to ensure adherence to standards and facilitate audits.

3. Risk Management and Safety-Critical Systems

    > For projects that involve safety-critical systems or high-risk environments, such as aviation, 
    > nuclear energy, or medical devices, structured methodologies provide rigorous risk management 
    > and testing. The Spiral Model, in particular, incorporates risk analysis in every iteration, 
    > making it a suitable choice for such projects.

4. Long-Term, Large-Scale Projects

    > When working on large-scale projects with long development timelines, structured methodologies 
    > help manage complexity through clear stages and milestones. If the project involves significant 
    > investments and long durations, a structured approach helps ensure consistent progress and 
    > stakeholder alignment.

5. Need for Extensive Documentation

    > If detailed documentation is required for handover, future maintenance, or regulatory reasons, 
    > a structured methodology is beneficial. These methods emphasise creating thorough documentation 
    > at each phase, which ensures that all aspects of the system are clearly recorded for future use.

6. Team Size and Structure

    > Structured methodologies can be more effective for large teams or organisations that require 
    > defined roles, responsibilities, and workflows. If your team is large and dispersed, a structured 
    > methodology provides clarity and coordination across multiple stakeholders.

7. Predictability and Fixed Budgets

    > If the project requires a fixed budget and schedule, structured approaches provide a higher 
    > level of predictability. Since these methodologies follow a linear process with clear timelines, 
    > they can help avoid scope creep and ensure cost control.

8. Less Emphasis on Customer Involvement

    > Structured methodologies are suitable when customer feedback is not needed during the 
    > development process. If customers or users do not need to be involved in iterative feedback 
    > loops, a structured approach can be more efficient.
