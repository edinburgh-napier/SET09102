# Practical ways to use General Systems Theory concepts

1. Think in Terms of Subsystems and Modularity

    > Break down your codebase into smaller, self-contained modules or services. Treat each module as a 
    > subsystem that handles a specific responsibility, such as user authentication, payment processing, 
    > or data storage.
    > 
    > This reduces complexity, makes the code easier to maintain, and allows individual parts of the 
    > system to evolve without affecting the entire codebase.
    > 
    > Example: In an object-oriented context, treat each class as an independent subsystem 
    > that interacts with others via public interfaces, keeping the boundaries clear and functionality 
    > focused.

2. Leverage Feedback Loops for Continuous Improvement

    > Implement feedback loops through continuous testing and user feedback. Set up automated tests 
    > (unit, integration, performance) to ensure code changes don’t break existing functionality, and 
    > gather user feedback post-deployment to guide future improvements.
    > 
    > Feedback loops allow for continuous improvement by catching errors early and providing a mechanism 
    > to adapt the system to user needs.
    > 
    > Example: Use CI/CD pipelines to automatically run tests whenever code is pushed, providing 
    > immediate feedback to developers on the impact of their changes.

3. Ensure Open System Adaptability

    > Design systems to be open by allowing them to interact with external systems and environments 
    > (e.g., APIs, external databases, third-party services). Keep adaptability in mind by making 
    > these interactions configurable.
    > 
    > Open systems must handle changes in their environment, such as API updates or fluctuating loads. 
    > By designing for adaptability, you can ensure your system evolves with its external dependencies.
    > 
    > Example: Use environment variables and configuration files for external API keys and service 
    > endpoints to allow your system to adapt without hardcoding dependencies.

4. Strive for System Homeostasis

    > Implement self-regulating mechanisms that ensure your system remains stable under changing 
    > conditions, such as increased traffic or resource failures. Tools like load balancers and 
    > auto-scaling ensure your system can handle fluctuations without manual intervention.
    > 
    > Maintaining homeostasis prevents system failures under stress and ensures consistent performance.
    > 
    > Example: Use cloud services like [AWS Auto Scaling](https://aws.amabehavioron.com/autoscaling/) 
    > to automatically adjust the number of instances running based on traffic, ensuring system 
    > stability during peak usage.

5. Refactor to Reduce Entropy

    > Regularly refactor your code to reduce technical debt and complexity, keeping the system 
    > organised and efficient. Address code smells, redundant code, and inefficient design patterns 
    > before they lead to larger issues.
    > 
    > As systems evolve, entropy increases in the form of technical debt, making the system harder to 
    > manage. Refactoring helps maintain order and prevent degradation over time.
    > 
    > Example: Schedule code reviews and refactoring sprints to identify and address areas of high 
    > entropy in your codebase, such as overly complex functions or outdated libraries.

6. Embrace Emergence through Collaboration

    > Foster collaboration and knowledge sharing within your development team to create innovative 
    > solutions. The emergent behaviour of a system often arises from the combined knowledge and 
    > expertise of the team rather than from individual components.
    > 
    > Emergent properties can lead to creative, high-performing solutions that wouldn’t emerge from 
    > individual work alone.
    > 
    > Example: Organise brainstorming sessions or pair programming sessions to tackle complex 
    > challenges, allowing different perspectives and ideas to emerge and shape the solution.

7. Monitor and Analyse System Interconnectedness

    > Use monitoring tools like Prometheus, [Grafana](https://grafana.com/), or 
    > [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/) to track how different parts of your system interact and 
    > affect each other. Analyse how changes in one part of the system impact other parts.
    > 
    > Interconnected systems can exhibit complex behaviours where changes in one component have 
    > unexpected side effects on others. Monitoring helps you understand and anticipate these effects.
    > 
    > Example: Set up [application performance monitoring](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterprisedesktop/definition/Application-monitoring-app-monitoring) 
    > (APM) to track how database query times affect web page load times or how microservice response 
    > times affect the overall user experience.

8. Document and Define Boundaries Clearly

    > Clearly define and document boundaries between different components or subsystems, especially when 
    > working with APIs, services, or modules. Ensure each system’s responsibilities are well-understood, 
    > and avoid coupling between subsystems.
    > 
    > Well-defined boundaries reduce dependencies and make it easier to isolate issues, debug problems, 
    > or update specific components without affecting others.
    > 
    > Example: Use interface-based designs in object-oriented programming to enforce separation 
    > between subsystems. For example, in a C# project, define service interfaces that clients 
    > interact with, keeping the underlying implementations decoupled and changeable.

9. Design for Adaptation and Scalability

    > Build your system with scalability and adaptation in mind, ensuring it can grow or change as 
    > user demands or technology evolve. Use cloud services that offer flexible scaling options or 
    > modular architectures that allow new features to be integrated easily.
    > 
    > A system designed for adaptation can evolve over time without major overhauls, making it more 
    > future-proof and cost-effective in the long run.
    > 
    > Example: Use containerisation with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or 
    > [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) to make your system easily scalable and portable across 
    > environments, allowing it to adapt to changing demands or deployment requirements.

10. Use System Hierarchies to Simplify Complex Systems

    > Break down complex systems into hierarchical layers, where each layer handles a specific set of 
    > concerns. For example, create distinct layers for data access, business logic, and presentation 
    > in your application architecture.
    > 
    > A hierarchical structure simplifies development by separating concerns, making systems easier 
    > to understand, maintain, and debug.
    > 
    > Example: Implement a layered architecture in web development with a frontend that handles user 
    > interaction, a backend service that processes business logic, and a separate database layer for 
    > persistent storage.

11. Plan for System Evolution

    > Design your system with the expectation that it will evolve. Plan for regular updates, feature 
    > expansions, and adaptations to user feedback. Ensure the system architecture allows for easy 
    > updates and extensions.
    > 
    > Systems must evolve to stay relevant. Designing for evolution ensures that changes can be 
    > integrated smoothly without disrupting the overall system.
    > 
    > Example: In an Agile environment, continuously iterate on your codebase, incorporating new 
    > features based on user feedback and market changes. Keep your code modular to allow easy 
    > additions or modifications.
