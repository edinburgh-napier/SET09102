# Professional Codes of Ethics

Some professions such as medicine and law require practitioners to maintain their status
and right to practice through a legally recognised certification process. Software engineering
does not have an equivalent system, and therefore membership of professional bodies and
adherence to their codes of practice are essentially voluntary. There is still an expectation
though that a computing professional will act with the same level of integrity as defined by
such codes.

In relation to software engineering, the most widely referenced professional code of
ethics is maintained by the
[Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics). It is divided
into four main parts as shown below.

<details>
<summary>1. General ethical principles</summary>

> [1.1 Contribute to society and to human well-being, acknowledging that all people are stakeholders
in computing](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics#h-1.1-contribute-to-society-and-to-human-well-being,-acknowledging-that-all-people-are-stakeholders-in-computing.).

The
[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)](https://www.ieee.org/about/corporate/governance/p7-8.html)
code of ethics is also widely used, and in the UK the
[British Computer Society (BCS)](https://www.bcs.org/membership-and-registrations/become-a-member/bcs-code-of-conduct/)
acts as the professional body for the computing industry. Its code of conduct is also based
on four principles as shown below.

<details>
<summary>You make IT for everyone</summary>

> Working together to address issues in your profession and in wider society, you want
> everyone to have access to IT. You share what you know, uphold standards and conduct
> yourself professionally and fairly at all times.

>
> 1. have due regard for public health, privacy, security and wellbeing of others and the environment
