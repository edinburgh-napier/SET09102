# Practical tips for the ethical use of AI and AI development tools

1. Understand the Data You Are Using

    > Ethics in AI begins with understanding the data you use for training models. Familiarise yourself 
    > with where your data comes from, how it was collected, and any potential biases it may contain. Be 
    > cautious with datasets that may be biased or unrepresentative of your target audience. Use diverse, 
    > representative datasets to avoid skewing results and producing biased outputs.

2. Avoid Over-Collecting Personal Data

    > When developing AI systems, collect only the data that is necessary for your model’s purpose. Avoid 
    > gathering excessive personal data that could compromise privacy. Ensure that any personal data you 
    > do collect is managed responsibly, with robust security measures and adherence to data privacy laws 
    > such as GDPR. Using anonymised or aggregated data where possible is a good practice to minimise 
    > risks to user privacy.

3. Regularly Test and Validate Models for Fairness

    > Ensure your AI models treat all groups fairly by conducting fairness and bias checks. Tools like 
    > IBM’s AI Fairness 360 and Microsoft’s Fairlearn can help you test for biased outcomes. Regular 
    > validation against diverse user groups will ensure your model performs equitably, with metrics that 
    > track fairness across different demographics.

4. Prioritise Explainability and Transparency

    > Choose AI models that offer transparency in their decision-making, especially if they influence 
    > important decisions, like hiring or credit scoring. Explainability tools, such as SHAP (Shapley 
    > Additive Explanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations), can help clarify 
    > why the AI makes certain decisions. Users should understand, at least at a basic level, how the AI 
    > operates and what factors influence its outputs.

5. Consider Potential Societal Impacts

    > Ethics in AI means considering the broader social impact of your system. Ask yourself how your AI 
    > application could affect people’s lives or society, especially in critical areas like healthcare, 
    > finance, or law enforcement. Ensure your AI systems are designed to minimise harm, avoid 
    > discrimination, and uphold the welfare of all users.

6. Maintain User Privacy and Data Security

    > Protecting user privacy and data security is essential in any AI system. Use encryption for data at 
    > rest and in transit, ensure secure access controls, and follow best practices for data storage. 
    > Transparency about data use, clear privacy policies, and providing users with control over their 
    > data (such as options to opt out) are all fundamental ethical practices.

7. Be Aware of Dark Patterns in AI Use

    > Avoid using AI in ways that manipulate or mislead users (known as dark patterns). These include 
    > techniques that subtly nudge users into decisions they may not want to make, such as hidden 
    > subscription renewals or overly aggressive personalisation. Design AI systems that respect user 
    > autonomy and promote informed decision-making.

8. Monitor and Review Models After Deployment

    > AI systems may change behaviour over time as data shifts, so continuous monitoring is critical. 
    > Regularly audit your AI systems for fairness, accuracy, and performance. This ongoing review helps 
    > you detect and correct any ethical issues that emerge post-deployment, such as biases or data drift.

9. Involve a Diverse Team for Broader Perspectives

    > Involve diverse team members in your AI development process. Different perspectives can help 
    > identify potential ethical issues that may go unnoticed by a homogeneous team. Collaboration with 
    > people from various backgrounds can reduce unintentional biases and promote inclusivity in AI design.

10. Stay Informed About AI Regulations and Ethical Standards

    > Familiarise yourself with AI regulations and ethical standards, such as the EU’s AI Act, UK AI 
    > guidance, or your organisation’s internal ethics policies. Keeping up with industry guidelines 
    > helps you align your work with current best practices and legal requirements. Following codes of 
    > ethics from professional bodies like the ACM or IEEE can also provide a strong ethical foundation 
    > for AI development.

11. Provide Transparency in AI Decision-Making

    > Clearly communicate the role of AI in your application, especially if it influences important user 
    > decisions. For example, if a recommendation system filters job candidates, inform users about how 
    > AI is involved and its limitations. This transparency can build trust and helps users understand 
    > the AI’s role in their experience.

12. Be Prepared to Take Responsibility for AI Decisions

    > AI is often perceived as an objective tool, but in reality, it reflects the data and parameters 
    > it’s built upon. As a developer, be prepared to take responsibility for your AI’s outputs, addressing 
    > and correcting unintended consequences or biases. This commitment to ethical responsibility will 
    > encourage you to continually improve your systems for the benefit of all users.
