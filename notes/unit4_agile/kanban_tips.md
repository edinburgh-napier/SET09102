# Practical tips for implementing Kanban

1. Start by Visualising the Workflow

    > Begin by mapping out your current process on a Kanban board to make each stage of work 
    > visible. Identify all the steps from task creation to completion and create columns that 
    > reflect these stages (e.g., _Backlog_, _To Do_, _In Progress_, _In Review_, _Done_). Involve 
    > the entire team in setting up the board to ensure it reflects everyone’s work accurately. 
    > This visualisation provides transparency and helps the team see how work flows through each 
    > stage.

2. Define Clear WIP Limits Gradually

    > Limit the amount of work that can be in each stage (Work in Progress or WIP limit) to 
    > prevent overloading team members and to promote focus. Start with generous limits as you 
    > get used to Kanban and gradually tighten them based on team capacity. This can reduce 
    > multitasking, increase task completion rates, and help the team identify bottlenecks.

3. Use Simple, Clear Task Descriptions

    > Ensure that each task has a well-defined description so team members understand what needs to 
    > be done without ambiguity. Clear task descriptions make it easier for everyone to pick up tasks 
    > and keep work moving forward. Use checklists within tasks for complex work items to help 
    > clarify steps and reduce misunderstandings.

4. Establish a Definition of Done (DoD)

    > Create a Definition of Done (DoD) that outlines what needs to be completed for a task to move 
    > from one stage to the next. This might include specific tests, code reviews, or documentation 
    > updates. The DoD ensures consistency in work quality and helps the team avoid incomplete work 
    > moving forward in the process.

5. Identify and Address Bottlenecks

    > As the team begins to work with Kanban, observe where tasks tend to accumulate, indicating 
    > bottlenecks. Use these observations to identify areas that need more resources or improved 
    > processes. For example, if tasks consistently pile up _In Review_, consider adding more 
    > reviewers or automating certain tests to speed things up.

6. Prioritise Continuous Improvement

    > Hold regular retrospectives, even if they’re brief, to discuss what’s working and what could 
    > be improved. Encourage the team to suggest small changes and experiment with adjustments. 
    > Continuous improvement is central to Kanban, helping the team refine the process based on their 
    > experiences and insights.

7. Track Flow Metrics

    > Monitor key metrics like cycle time (how long it takes to complete a task from start to finish) 
    > and lead time (total time from task creation to completion). These metrics offer insights into 
    > how efficiently work progresses through the system and help the team set realistic goals for 
    > improvement.

8. Use the Pull Principle

    > Let team members pull new tasks only when they have completed their current work, rather than 
    > pushing new tasks to them. This “pull” system encourages focus and reduces task switching. It 
    > also helps ensure that team members aren’t overloaded and can focus on completing tasks 
    > thoroughly.

9. Adapt the Board as You Go

    > Don’t worry about getting the board perfect on the first try. Adjust columns, WIP limits, and 
    > task definitions as the team becomes more comfortable with Kanban and gains a better 
    > understanding of their workflow. Flexibility helps the board evolve into a useful tool for 
    > tracking and managing work.

10. Encourage Open Communication

    > Promote open communication among team members. Use daily standups to discuss work on the board, 
    > any blockers, and any adjustments needed in the workflow. Open discussions help the team 
    > collaborate effectively and support each other, ensuring the Kanban board reflects the true 
    > state of work.
