Although Scrum is the most widely-used agile methodology, there are other such as 
[Kanban](https://kanbanize.com/kanban-resources) which dispense with sprints and adopt a fully
continuous process instead. Despite their differences, there is a large degree of overlap in agile
methods, and a practical implementation of agile will include elements from more than one.

For a discussion of agile methods, please read [Stephens, 2022, Ch. 19](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/beginning-software-engineering/9781119901709/c19.xhtml#please-read)

## DevOps

Because an agile project is delivering working software in a continuous series of increments, it then
becomes possible to automate some of the essential steps in the process. The current term for this
is *DevOps*, a compound of *Development* and  *Operations*. The main goal is to eliminate delays and
human error involved in some of the routine aspects of software quality assurance including,
for example, building, testing and even deployment. *Continuous integration* (CI) is the terms used
to indicate that changes to a software application are automatically assembled, compiled and tested.
The process is often visualised as a series of steps known as a *pipeline*. Going one step further
and automatically releasing and deploying software increments is known as *Continuous deployment* (CD).
CD is obviously a more risky proposition that CI and a complete CI/CD pipeline includes rigorous
verification and monitoring steps before software is actually released to users as illustrated in
Fig. 10.
