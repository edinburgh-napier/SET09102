Maybe we want to constrain the computation, the AI, to only do things we consider ethical. But somehow we have to find a way to describe what we mean by that.

According to a recent
[magazine article](https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-jobs-at-risk-replacement-artificial-intelligence-ai-labor-trends-2023-02?r=US&IR=T#tech-jobs-coders-computer-programmers-software-engineers-data-analysts-1),
the top 10 careers most at risk from generative AI are

1. Tech jobs (Coders, computer programmers, software engineers, data analysts)
2. Media jobs (advertising, content creation, technical writing, journalism)
3. Legal industry jobs (paralegals, legal assistants)
4. Market research analysts
5. Teachers
6. Finance jobs (Financial analysts, personal financial advisors)
7. Traders
8. Graphic designers
9. Accountants
10. Customer service agents

Is it significant that software engineering appears at the top of the list above? Well,
the article did not claim that it was an ordered list, but the main implication is that
those going into a career in software engineering at this moment need to know about the
available tools and how to use them effectively.
