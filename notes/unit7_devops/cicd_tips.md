# Practical tips for getting started wit continuous integration

1. Start with a Simple Workflow

    > Begin by setting up a basic workflow that includes essential stages, like building the code and 
    > running unit tests. In GitHub Actions, you can do this by creating a `.yml` file in the 
    > `.github/workflows` directory, for example, `ci.yml`. Define a simple job that runs on each push to 
    > your repository’s main branch or on pull requests, which will give you immediate feedback on every 
    > change.

2. Use Predefined Actions

    > GitHub Actions provides a wide range of predefined actions you can use to simplify your workflow, from 
    > setting up specific programming environments to running tests. For example, `actions/setup-node` or 
    > `actions/setup-dotnet` can prepare your development environment with the correct version of Node.js or 
    > .NET, which saves you the trouble of configuring each step manually.

3. Automate Dependency Installation

    > Use GitHub Actions to automate the installation of dependencies as part of the workflow. In a .NET 
    > project, for example, you can add a step to run `dotnet restore`, ensuring that all dependencies are in 
    > place before building or testing the application. This step ensures consistency across all builds and 
    > helps catch any missing dependencies early.

4. Run Tests on Every Push

    > Configure your CI pipeline to run tests on each push or pull request. For example, in your .yml file, 
    > include a command to execute unit tests, such as dotnet test for .NET projects. Running tests on every 
    > push helps catch issues early, and having the CI pipeline enforce this is a great way to ensure you 
    > don’t accidentally skip tests.

5. Use Matrix Builds for Multiple Environments

    > For testing across multiple versions or configurations, use GitHub Actions’ matrix builds. This allows 
    > you to define several environments in your workflow, such as different operating systems (Windows, 
    > macOS, Linux) or versions of a runtime (e.g., Node.js 14, 16, 18), and GitHub Actions will run the 
    > workflow for each. This setup ensures compatibility and reduces potential issues in production.

6. Check Code Quality with Linting and Static Analysis

    > Integrate tools like ESLint for JavaScript or SonarCloud for static analysis into your GitHub Actions 
    > workflow to automatically check for code quality issues. Adding a linting or analysis step as part of 
    > the CI process helps maintain clean, consistent code and allows you to address potential bugs early.

7. Define Specific Branches for CI

    > When setting up GitHub Actions, specify that workflows should run on specific branches, such as `main` 
    > and `development`. This approach ensures that only approved branches trigger the CI pipeline, allowing 
    > you to keep CI runs focused on production-ready or pre-production code changes.

8. Review Logs to Debug Failures

    > When your CI workflow fails, use the logs that GitHub Actions provides to understand the issue. The 
    > logs show each step’s output, which helps identify where the failure occurred. This is especially 
    > useful for debugging early on and will make troubleshooting future issues easier.

9. Use Secrets for Sensitive Information

    > If your CI pipeline requires sensitive information like API keys, store these as encrypted secrets in 
    > GitHub, which you can reference in your workflow file. For example, using `${{ secrets.API_KEY }}` ensures 
    > your sensitive data remains secure and is not hardcoded into your repository.

10. Iterate and Optimise Your Pipeline

    > Once you have a basic workflow running, gradually add more stages, like integration tests or code 
    > coverage analysis. Optimise your pipeline to keep it efficient and focused, and consider running 
    > certain tasks in parallel to speed up the process.

11. Utilise Notifications for Feedback

    > Set up notifications to alert you when a workflow fails or succeeds. This feedback allows you to react 
    > quickly, fixing issues as soon as they occur and maintaining a clean codebase.
