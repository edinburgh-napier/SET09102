Because an agile project is delivering working software in a continuous series of increments, it then
becomes possible to automate some of the essential steps in the process. The current term for this
is *DevOps*, a compound of *Development* and  *Operations*.  DevOps is a transformative approach in software 
development organisations that merges development and operations to create a unified, efficient, and 
collaborative environment. Traditionally, development and operations teams worked in silos, often leading to 
bottlenecks, misunderstandings, and delays in the delivery of software. DevOps breaks down these barriers, 
fostering a culture of shared responsibility, continuous improvement, and seamless integration. Through a 
combination of practices, cultural shifts, and automation tools, DevOps enables teams to deliver software 
rapidly and reliably by aligning development processes with operational requirements. Key principles in 
DevOps include continuous integration, continuous delivery, automated testing, and monitoring, all of which 
aim to streamline the software lifecycle and ensure high-quality releases. By prioritising collaboration, 
DevOps not only accelerates time-to-market but also enhances product stability and responsiveness to user 
needs, making it an invaluable framework for modern software organisations.

The main goal is to eliminate delays and
human error involved in some of the routine aspects of software quality assurance including,
for example, building, testing and even deployment. *Continuous integration* (CI) is the terms used
to indicate that changes to a software application are automatically assembled, compiled and tested.
The process is often visualised as a series of steps known as a *pipeline*. Going one step further
and automatically releasing and deploying software increments is known as *Continuous deployment* (CD).
CD is obviously a more risky proposition that CI and a complete CI/CD pipeline includes rigorous
verification and monitoring steps before software is actually released to users as illustrated in
Fig. 10.
