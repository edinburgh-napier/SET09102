# Practical tips for getting started with Infrastructure as Code

1. Start with a Small Project

    > Begin with a small, manageable project to understand the basics of IaC. For example, try setting up a 
    > simple web server or database using IaC in a cloud provider like AWS or Azure. This will help you 
    > grasp core IaC concepts without getting overwhelmed by complexity.

2. Choose a Beginner-Friendly IaC Tool

    > Start with tools that have straightforward syntax and good community support. AWS CloudFormation, 
    > Terraform, and Azure Resource Manager (ARM) are widely used IaC tools with extensive documentation. 
    > Terraform is particularly popular for beginners due to its flexibility and cross-cloud compatibility.

3. Learn Version Control Basics

    > Store your IaC scripts in version control (e.g., Git), just like application code. This practice 
    > allows you to track changes, roll back configurations, and collaborate with others. If you’re new 
    > to Git, focus on core commands (e.g., commit, push, pull) to keep things simple.

4. Understand the Declarative Nature of IaC

    > Most IaC tools use a declarative syntax, where you define the desired state of resources (e.g., “I want 
    > two servers in this network”) rather than specifying step-by-step instructions. Familiarise yourself 
    > with how this works, as it differs from traditional programming and is central to how IaC tools operate.

5. Learn to Use a Test Environment

    > Experimenting with IaC in a test environment, such as a cloud sandbox or local development environment, 
    > allows you to make mistakes safely. Avoid deploying IaC scripts to production while you’re learning, 
    > as small errors can lead to unintended infrastructure changes or costs.

6. Get Comfortable with Cloud Provider Documentation

    > IaC is often closely tied to cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud). Familiarise yourself 
    > with the provider’s documentation for the resources you’re using, as it explains how to configure 
    > instances, networking, databases, and other services. Cloud provider docs are essential references 
    > for creating accurate IaC scripts.

7. Use Parameterisation for Reusability

    > Most IaC tools support variables or parameters, which allow you to create reusable templates. For 
    > example, use variables to define instance sizes or region locations instead of hardcoding values. 
    > This practice improves flexibility and makes your templates adaptable to different environments.

8. Test Your Configurations Locally if Possible

    > Some IaC tools, like Terraform, offer commands like terraform plan, which simulate changes without 
    > applying them, allowing you to preview infrastructure changes safely. Use these preview commands to 
    > check for errors before making actual changes.

9. Automate with CI/CD When Ready

    > Once you’re comfortable with basic IaC concepts, consider automating IaC deployments as part of a 
    > CI/CD pipeline. This approach integrates infrastructure changes into your development workflow, 
    > supporting continuous delivery of both code and infrastructure.

10. Learn by Reading and Experimenting with Examples

    > Browse public repositories or IaC tutorials to see examples of real-world infrastructure 
    > configurations. Experiment with these examples, modify them, and observe how different configurations 
    > affect resources. Practising with examples will help solidify your understanding.

11. Track Resources and Costs

    > As IaC automates resource creation, it’s easy to create more infrastructure than you intended, which 
    > can lead to unexpected cloud costs. Learn to track your resources through the cloud provider’s dashboard 
    > or billing reports, and delete resources when they’re no longer needed.

12. Document Your IaC Configurations

    > Document each IaC configuration’s purpose, settings, and dependencies. This practice not only helps 
    > you remember your work but also allows others to understand and collaborate on your configurations 
    > easily.
